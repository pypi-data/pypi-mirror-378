## üì¶ Installation

Install Vizify using pip:

```bash
pip install vizify
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Import the Package

```python
from vizify import Vizify
```

### 2. Generate a Basic Visualization Report

```python
from vizify import Vizify

# Initialize Vizify with a CSV file
viz = Vizify("your_data.csv")
viz.show_all_visualizations()
```

After execution, a file named `data_visualization_report.pdf` will be created in your working directory containing all the visualizations.

### 3. Generate a Visualization Report with AI Interpretation

```python
from vizify import Vizify

viz = Vizify("your_data.csv", api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY")#Place your API KEY here
viz.show_all_visualizations()
```

### 4. Launch Interactive Dashboard (NEW)

Run Vizify as a script to access the interactive dashboard:

```bash
python -c "from vizify import run_dashboard; run_dashboard()"
```

Or use the command-line interface:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This will prompt you to choose between PDF report or interactive dashboard
    from vizify import main
    main()
```
