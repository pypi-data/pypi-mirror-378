**MNE-LSL** [(Documentation website)](https://mne.tools/mne-lsl)
provides a real-time brain signal streaming framework.
**MNE-LSL** contains an improved python-binding for the Lab Streaming Layer C++ library,
`mne_lsl.lsl`, replacing `pylsl`. This low-level binding is used in high-level objects
to interact with LSL streams.

Any signal acquisition system supported by native LSL or OpenVibe is also
supported by MNE-LSL. Since the data communication is based on TCP, signals can be
transmitted wirelessly. For more information about LSL, please visit the
[LSL github](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer).

# Install

MNE-LSL supports `python ≥ 3.10` and is available on
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mne-lsl/) and on
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mne-lsl).
Install instruction can be found on the
[documentation website](https://mne.tools/mne-lsl/stable/resources/install.html).

**MNE-LSL** is based on **BSL** and **NeuroDecode**. The original version developed by
[**Kyuhwa Lee**](https://github.com/dbdq) was recognised at
[Microsoft Brain Signal Decoding competition](https://github.com/dbdq/microsoft_decoding)
with the First Prize Award (2016).
**MNE-LSL** is based on the refactor version, **BSL** by
[**Mathieu Scheltienne**](https://github.com/mscheltienne) and
[**Arnaud Desvachez**](https://github.com/dnastars) for the
[Fondation Campus Biotech Geneva (FCBG)](https://github.com/fcbg-platforms) and
development is still supported by the
[Fondation Campus Biotech Geneva (FCBG)](https://fcbg.ch/).
