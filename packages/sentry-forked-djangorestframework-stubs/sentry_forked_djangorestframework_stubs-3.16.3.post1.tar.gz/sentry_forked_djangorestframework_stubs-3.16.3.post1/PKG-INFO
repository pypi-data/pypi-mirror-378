=======================================

### new release

make a new branch for the fork of an upstream tag:

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:typeddjango/djangorestframework-stubs
git fetch upstream --tags
git push origin --tags
git checkout 1.2.3 -b sentry-1.2.3
```

- cherry-pick the craft / release commit(s) into your branch from `master`
- cherry-pick relevant commit(s) from previous releases

releases are done through craft in the release.yml workflow -- make sure to
target your particular branch with a `-#` release postfix (like `1.2.3-1`)

# pep484 stubs for Django REST framework

Mypy stubs for [Django REST Framework](https://pypi.org/project/djangorestframework/).
Supports Python 3.10 and up.

## Installation

```bash
pip install djangorestframework-stubs[compatible-mypy]
```

To make mypy aware of the plugin, you need to add

```ini
[mypy]
plugins =
    mypy_drf_plugin.main
```

in your `mypy.ini` file.

## FAQ

### Model instance is inferred as `Any` instead of my `Model` class

When subclassing `ModelSerializer`, add a [type argument](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#generics) to type-hint the related model class, for example:

```python
class MyModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer[MyModel]):
    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        fields = ("id", "example")
```

Which means that methods where the model is being passed around will know the actual type of the model instead of being `Any`. The `instance` attribute on the above serializer will be `MyModel | typing.Sequence[MyModel] | None`.
