"""
The pyav container stores the information based
on the packets timestamps (called 'pts'). Some
of the packets are considered key_frames because
they include those key frames.

Also, this library uses those key frames to start
decodifying from there to the next one, obtaining
all the frames in between able to be read and
modified.

This cache system will look for the range of 
frames that belong to the key frame related to the
frame we are requesting in the moment, keeping in
memory all those frames to be handled fast. It
will remove the old frames if needed to use only
the 'size' we set when creating it.

A stream can have 'fps = 60' but use another
different time base that make the pts values go 0,
 256, 512... for example. The 'time_base' is the
only accurate way to obtain the pts.

Feel free to move this explanation to other
place, its about the duration.

The stream 'duration' parameter is measured
on ticks, the amount of ticks that the
stream lasts. Here below is an example:

- Duration raw: 529200
- Time base: 1/44100
- Duration (seconds): 12.0

"""
There is a way of editing videos being
able to arbitrary access to frames, that
is transforming the source videos to
intra-frame videos. This is a ffmpeg
command that can do it:

- `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -x264opts keyint=1 -preset fast -crf 18 -c:a copy output_intra.mp4`

Once you have the 'output_intra.mp4',
each packet can decodify its frame 
depending not on the previous one, being
able to seek and jump easy.

There are 3 type of video codifications,
the I-frame (intra-coded), in which any
frame can be decoded by itself, P-frame
(predicted), that need one or more 
previous frames to be decoded, and 
B-frame (bidirectional predicted), that
needs previous and future frames.
