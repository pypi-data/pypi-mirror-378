# Generate Journal Insights

Ultrathink.

## Task
Read journal sessions in `sessions/**/*.md` and provide insights based on patterns across entries.

## Process
1. Read all session files thoroughly
2. Identify recurring themes, tensions, metaphors, and moments of realization
3. Generate pattern-based insights that connect across sessions
4. Save with timestamp to `sessions/insights/yyMMdd_HHmm_insights.md`

## Guidelines
- **Be specific**: Reference actual quotes and moments
- **Stay observational**: Mirror patterns without prescribing solutions
- **Show connections**: Link themes across different sessions
- **Hold complexity**: Don't resolve tensions or paradoxes
- **Avoid**: Generic advice, therapeutic jargon, forced positivity

## Structure
- Thematic headings that capture essence
- Concise but meaningful observations
- Closing synthesis that threads key patterns together

## Tone
Compassionate, direct, insightful without preaching

## Key Question
After providing insights grounded closely in the user's journal entries, look for any insights that didn't come directly from their own observations, anything that might surprise them about what was noticed from their journal enries.
