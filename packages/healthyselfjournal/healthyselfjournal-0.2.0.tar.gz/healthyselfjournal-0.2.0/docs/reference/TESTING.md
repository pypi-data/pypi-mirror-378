# Testing

Use pytest for tests. Write a small number of high-level, high-coverage tests that cover the most important edge cases. Avoid mocking.

Notes:
- Prefer black-box style tests that exercise full flows (record → transcribe → prompt → write files) with temporary directories and real dependencies where feasible.
