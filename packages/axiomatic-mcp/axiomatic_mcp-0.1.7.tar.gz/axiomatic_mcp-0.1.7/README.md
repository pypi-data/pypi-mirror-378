# Axiomatic MCP Servers

[![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Join%20Discord-5865f2?style=flat)](https://discord.gg/KKU97ZR5)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that provide AI assistants with access to the Axiomatic_AI Platform - a suite of advanced tools for scientific computing, document processing, and photonic circuit design.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### System requirements

- Python
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

#### 1. Get an API key

> **Note:** This installs all tools under one server and may cause issues with some clients. If you experience problems, install individual servers instead.

## Individual servers

You may find more information about each server and how to install them individually in their own READMEs.

## Troubleshooting

### Server not appearing in Cursor

1. Restart Cursor after updating MCP settings
2. Check the Output panel (View → Output → MCP) for errors
3. Verify the command path is correct

### Multiple servers overwhelming the LLM

Install only the domain servers you need. Each server runs independently, so you can add/remove them as needed.

### API connection errors

1. Verify your API key is set correctly
2. Check internet connection

### Tools not appearing

If you experience any issues such as tools not appearing, it may be that you are using an old version and need to clear uv's cache to update it.

```bash
uv cache clean
```

Then restart your MCP client (e.g. restart Cursor).

This clears the uv cache and forces fresh downloads of packages on the next run.
