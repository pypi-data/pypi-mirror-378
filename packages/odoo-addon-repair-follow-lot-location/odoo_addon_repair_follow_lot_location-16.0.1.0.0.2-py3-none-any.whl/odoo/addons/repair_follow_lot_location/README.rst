In base module, the repair order current location is chosen manually by
the user to represent where the item to repair physically sits. When the
product moves between internal locations during the process, the field
can become outdated.

This addon keeps the repair order location aligned with the *actual*
internal location of the linked lot/serial.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Usage
=====

1. Create a **Repair Order** and set the **Lot/Serial**
2. Check the box **Follow Lot Location**
3. As warehouse operations progress, do stock moves as usual
4. When the relevant moves are **Done**, the repairâ€™s current location
   updates automatically
