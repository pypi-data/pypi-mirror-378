# This file describes the groups of plots we can make with the rail_plotting module


# Where to find the plot and dataet definitions
Includes:
  - tests/ci_plots.yaml
  - tests/ci_datasets.yaml


# Each of these will back a group of plots, by taking the product of the
# plots in the name PlotterList with the datasets in the DatasetList
PlotGroups:

  # Make plots of point estimates v. true redshifts
  - PlotGroup:
      name: zestimate_v_ztrue_test_plots
      plotter_list_name: zestimate_v_ztrue
      dataset_list_name: baseline_test

  # Make plots of accuracy as a function of true redshift
  - PlotGroup:
      name: accuracy_v_ztrue
      plotter_list_name: accuracy_v_ztrue
      dataset_list_name: baseline_merged


  # Make plots of biweight stags
  - PlotGroup:
      name: biweight_stats
      plotter_list_name: biweight_stats
      dataset_list_name: baseline_test


  # Make plots of n(z) in various tomographic bins
  - PlotGroup:
      name: tomo_bins
      plotter_list_name: tomo_bins
      dataset_list_name: blend_baseline_tomo_knn


  # Make plots of input catalog quantities
  - PlotGroup:
      name: catalog_plots
      plotter_list_name: catalog_plots
      dataset_list_name: blend_baseline_catalog
