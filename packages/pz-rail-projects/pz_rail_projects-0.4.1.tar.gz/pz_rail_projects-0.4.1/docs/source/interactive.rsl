Interactive Interface
*********************

The `rail_projects` package has a two-part command line interface (CLI).  One
part (`rail_project`) works with the tools in `rail.projects` and helps to manage
analysis projects.   The other part (`rail_plot`)  works with the tools in `rail.plotting`
and helps to make plots.
