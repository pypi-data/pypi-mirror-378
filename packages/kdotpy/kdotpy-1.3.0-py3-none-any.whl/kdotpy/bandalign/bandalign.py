	"""Get band indices (worker function)
	This function prepares data for band alignment, and performs the appropriate
	extrapolations in order to try and fill in the band indices for all points
	in the input data.

	Arguments:
	data         DiagData instance. Result from diagonalization functions, which
	             may be for a multi-dimensional grid.
	input_data   BandAlignData instance, DiagDataPoint instance or None. If set,
	             start with the band indices already defined there. If None,
	             infer band indices from e0.
	e0           Float or None. Energy where to 'pin' the band indices to. By
	             default for g0 = 0), this is the energy neutral gap, between
	             bands -1 and 1. If both e0 and input_data are not None, then e0
	             is prioritized.
	k0           Vector instance or None. Where to apply the energy e0 and start
	             the band alignment. If None, use the zero point of data.
	params       PhysParams instance.
	g0           Integer. Gap index at energy e0. The band indices below and
		         above the gap are set to -1 and 1 if g0 == 0, g0 - 1 and g0 if
		         g0 < 0, and g0 and g0 + 1 if g0 > 0. Only affects the result
		         when input_data is None and e0 is given.
	component    String or None. Vector component that is used as 'variable'.
	             For example, 'kx'.
	e0_relax     True or False. If False (default), require that both the
	             energies above and below the gap must be defined. If True,
	             allow one to be undefined. Applies only to 'pinning' to e0.
	auto_cnp     True or False. If True, try to determine the CNP if e0 has not
	             been specified. If False, do not attempt to calculate the CNP.

	Returns:
	ba_data   BandAlignData instance. Contains the band indices for as many data
