# Note on eoverhbar:
# The factor 1e-6 is included such that:
# eoverhbar * A (where A is vector potential in units of T nm) has a resulting
#   unit of nm^-1, as appropriate for a momentum quantity
# eoverhbar * b (where b is magnetic field / flux density in T) has a resulting
#   unit of nm^-2, so that multiplication by an area in nm^2 yields a
#   dimensionless quantity.
