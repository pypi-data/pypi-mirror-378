class ModelBase:
    """Basic dummy class for calculation models. This contains all function definitions independent of the exact model (e.g. 1D dispersion, LL mode, etc).

    Developer note:
    This class works together with classes DiagData(Point) and tasks.py to
    enable flexible configuration of multiprocessing and multithreading in
    kdotpy. While a DiagDataPoint instance holds the parameters for the model
    that are unique to that point, the Model class defines the which steps need
    to be calculated for all points (e.g. Hamiltonian construction,
    diagonalization, postprocessing). Tasks hold the information needed to
    dispatch all model steps for each DiagDataPoint to worker threads/processes.

    Since sending objects between processes in python involves (un-)pickling all
    the necessary information into a byte stream, some wrappers are needed to
    correctly execute the code in worker and main threads. While the actual
    calculation workload happens in the worker processes, the data set needs to
    be passed back to the main process via callbacks, where data is updated.
    Processes do not share RAM!

    Public functions of this class used for steps and callbacks must return a
    function handle, which is stored in the Task instance. We use private
    (starting with '_') functions with the same name to for the actual
    implementations of the steps and callbacks. Note that steps are executed in
    the worker context, while callbacks are executed in the main process.

    See GitLab MR !4 or issues #24,#25 for more information.
