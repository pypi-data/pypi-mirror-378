	                   equivalent to the weight of the current iteration result

	                   in any case.

	                   how far away the last potential difference is from

	debug              True or False. Enable or disable debug mode. In debug
	                   mode, write temporary files and re-raise SelfConError and

	                   useful to get traceback (for debugging). Other exceptions
	                   are always re-raised.
	dynamic_time_step  True or False. Whether the time_step for the self-
	                   consistent calculation is adapted automatically (True)

	status             Integer. Current status; see attribute acceptable_status
	                   for a list. This also can have the additional value -1,
	                   meaning the calculation has not been completed.
	times              Array of floats. Cumulated (abstract) time at every
	                   iteration.
	diffsolver         Callable. The differential equation solver.

	                   diagonalize(), update_density() and solve_potential().
	                   Depending on the differential solver and time_step,
	                   diffs[i] may differ from vz[i] - vz[i-1].
	pdensz             List of 1-dim arrays. Particle densities after each
	                   iteration step. The array axis represents the z
	                   dependence. Electron-like states count as positive,
	                   hole-like states as negative.
	pdensz_bg          1-dim array or None. Background density as function of z.
	                   This density is added to the density coming from the band
	                   structure prior to solving the potential. In other words,
	                   this is the density without any filled state.

	                   result.

	                   relevant if dynamic_time_step is set to True. (read only)

	pdensz_e           1-dim array or None. Electron density as function of z.
	                   Set only after convergence.
	pdensz_h           1-dim array or None. Hole density as function of z. Set
	                   only after convergence.
	special_energies   A dict instance. For ef0, ef, etc.; see density.py.

	Methods:
	next_iter          Method to check abortion criteria and output status
	                   information
	check_acceptable_status  Check whether the current status is acceptable.

	                   dynamic time step adjustment.

	                   (read-only).
	status             Integer. Current status; see attribute acceptable_status

	pdensz_bg          1-dim array or None. Background density as function of z.
	                   This density is added to the density coming from the band

	                   Set only after convergence.
