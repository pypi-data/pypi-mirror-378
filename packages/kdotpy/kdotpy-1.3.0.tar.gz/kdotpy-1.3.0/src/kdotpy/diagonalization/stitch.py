def align_energies(e1, e2, align_exp = 4):
	"""Align two energy arrays.

	This is a slightly simplified version of bandalign.base.align_energies().
	Please see the information there.
	Note: We do not import bandalign.base.align_energies() as it gives rise to
	a circular dependency (between diagdata and bandalign, essentially) and
	because it is designed for something else, i.e., using it for stitching
	would be "Zweckentfremdung".

	Arguments:
	e1             Array of floats. First set of eigenvalues.
	e2             Array of floats. Second set of eigenvalues.
	align_exp      Float/integer. Exponent e of the minimization function, see
	               above. Unlike in bandalign.base.align_energies(), the value
	               'max' is not allowed.

	Note:
	The arrays e1 and e2 must be sorted in ascending order, otherwise the
	behaviour is undefined.

	Returns:
	l1, r1, l2, r2   Integers. Left and right indices of the overlapping
	                 regions in the arrays. The overlapping regions can be
	                 extracted as e1[l1:r1], e2[l2:r2]. The non-overlapping
	                 regions are e1[:l1], e2[:l2] on the left, e1[r1:], e2[r2:]
	                 on the right. Note that of each of these pairs, at most one
	                 member has length > 0. In other words, l1 = 0 or l2 = 0,
	                 and n1 - r1 = 0 or n2 - r2 = 0.

	Examples:
	align_energies([4,5], [0,1,2,3,4,5,6])  yields   4, [4,5], [4,5]
	align_energies([0,1,2,3,4,5,6], [4,5])  yields  -4, [4,5], [4,5]

	                 shape of these arrays must be (N, len(eival1)) and
