Command line reference
======================

Note: In the following, # #1 #2 denote parameters, usually numerical, unless
      stated otherwise. Bracketed arguments [#] are optional.
Note: The options themselves are not case sensitive and underscores are ignored.
      This is not necessarily valid for their (additional) parameters.


Call signatures
---------------

The kdotpy application is actually a collection of several subprograms, each of
which may be seen a separate python script.

All subprograms are called from the main script main.py, that is invoked by the
command kdotpy, provided that the kdotpy module has been installed correctly.
The call signature is

$ kdotpy xxx arg1 arg2 ...

where xxx is replaced by the subprogram label. The available subprograms are:

kdotpy 1d        For 1D dispersions, i.e., strip geometry.
kdotpy 2d        For 2D dispersions, i.e., slab geometry.
kdotpy ll        For 2D Landau level calculations.
kdotpy bulk      For bulk (3D) dispersions.
kdotpy bulk-ll   For Landau level calculations in 3D.
kdotpy merge     For replotting and/or merging existing data files.
kdotpy compare   For comparing data from two or more existing data files.
kdotpy batch     For doing a batch run.
kdotpy test      For running tests, useful for development purposes.
kdotpy help      For showing help from this file.
kdotpy doc       For showing development documentation.
kdotpy version   For showing the version number.

Alternatively, one may use

$ python3 -m kdotpy xxx arg1 arg2 ...


Definition of the layer stack
-----------------------------
lwell #         Thickness of the active layer (e.g., quantum well) in nm.
                (Alias: lqw, qw)
lbarr #1 [#2]   Thickness of the barrier layers in nm. If one thickness is
                given, assume this value for both barrier layers (bottom and
                top). If two thicknesses are given, the first and second
                argument refer to the bottom and top layer, respectively. The
                input 'lbarr #1 lbarr #2' is equivalent to 'lbarr #1 #2'.
                (Alias: lbar, lbarrier, bar, barr, barrier)
llayer #1 [#2 ...]
                Thicknesses of the layers in nm. The number of layers may be
                arbitrary, but the number of thicknesses must always be equal to
                the number of materials. This argument may not be combined with
                lwell and lbarr.
                (Alias: llayers, layer, layers, thickness, thicknesses,
                thicknesses, thick)
mwell #1 [#2]   Material for the well layer. See 'mlayer' on how to input a
                material. (Alias: mqw)
mbarr #1 [#2]   Material for the barrier layers. See 'mlayer' on how to input a
                material. (Alias: mbarrier, mbar)
mlayer #1 [#2 ...]
                Material specification for an arbitrary number of layers. Each
                material instance is a material id or compound (e.g., HgMnTe,
                HgCdTe), optionally followed by extra numerical arguments that
                define the composition. The composition can either be specified
                as par of the compound (chemical formula) or as these extra
                arguments. Fractions and percentages are both accepted. Thus,
                all of the following are equivalent: HgMnTe 2%, HgMnTe 0.02,
                HgMn0.02Te, Hg0.98Mn0.02Te, HgMn2%Te, HgMn_{0.02}Te, etc.
                NOTE: The chemical formula is case sensitive. This eliminates
                ambiguity. The number of specified materials must match the
                number of thicknesses (llayer; lwell and lbarr).
                (Alias: mater, material)
msubst #1 [#2]  Material for the substrate. This only sets the lattice constant
                which is used to calculate strain. If this argument is omitted,
                the strain is taken from the strain or the alattice argument.
                (Alias: msub, substrate, msubstrate)
ltypes #1       Define the type (purpose of each layer). The argument must be a
                string of the following letters whose length must match the
                number of layers in the stack:
                b       barrier
                c       cap
                d       doping
                q OR w  well
                s       spacer
                (Alias: ltype, lstack)
                NOTE: Some functions will work properly only if there is exactly
                one 'well' layer.
ldens #1 [#2 ...]
                For each layer, the 'background density' of charge, for example
                doping. There need to be as many values as there are layers. The
                values are expressed in e/nm^2.
                (Alias: layerdens, layerdensity)

Other geometrical parameters
----------------------------
zres #          Resolution in the z direction in nm. (Alias: lres)
width # [...]   Width of the sample (in the y direction. If 'width' is followed
                by a single number, this determines the width of the device in
                nm. If 'width' is followed by #1 * #2 or #1 x #2, where #1 is an
                integer, then #1 is interpreted as the number of sites ny and #2
                as the resolution yres in nm. If 'width' is followed by #1 / #2,
                then #1 is the total width in nm; the value #2 is interpreted as
                ny if it is an integer and as yres otherwise. If the
                configuration value 'lattice_ycoord_midpoints' is set to
                'false', then ny is increased by one. (Alias: w)
yres #          Resolution in the y direction in nm. (Alias: wres)
linterface #    Smoothing width of the interface in nm. (Alias: interface)
periodicy       Enables periodic boundary conditions in the y direction (only
                applies to 1d)
stripangle #    Angle in degrees between the translationally invariant direction
                of the strip/ribbon and the (100) lattice vector (kdotpy 1d
                only). Default: 0
                (Alias: ribbonangle)
stripdir #      Direction of the translationally invariant direction of the
                strip/ribbon in lattice coordinates. The argument may be a
                lattice vector, e.g., 130 for (1,3,0) or any of x, y, xy, and
                -xy (equivalent to 0, 90, 45, and -45 degrees). Only one
                argument 'stripangle' or 'stripdir' should be given.
                (Alias: ribbondir)
orientation # [#] [#]
                Orientation of the lattice. (Alias: orient)
                Possible patterns (ang = angle, dir = direction triplet):
                  ang          Rotation around z (like stripangle)
                  ang ang      Tilt z axis, then rotate around z axis
                  ang ang ang  Euler rotation z x z. Rotate around c axis, tilt
                               z axis, rotate around z axis
                  dir          Longitudinal direction x (like stripdir)
                  - dir        Growth direction z
                  dir dir      Longitudinal and growth direction x, z
                  - dir dir    Transversal and growth direction y, z
                  dir dir dir  Longitudinal, transversal, and growth direction
                               x, y, z
                  dir ang OR ang dir
                               Growth direction z and rotation around z
                Format for the inputs: For angles ('ang'), enter an explicit
                floating point number containing a decimal sign (period '.').
                Integer values (for example 45 degrees) can be entered as 45.,
                45.0, 45d, or 45°. Direction triplets ('dir') are a triplet of
                digits without separators and possibly with minus signs (e.g.,
                100, 111, 11-2, -110) or numbers separated by commas without
                spaces (e.g., 1,1,0 or 10,-10,3).
NOTE: If the option 'orientation' is used, the program uses an alternative
construction method for the Hamiltonian, which may cause the time consumption by
this step to increase by a factor of approximately 4. There is no exception for
trivial orientations, like 'orientation - 001', which still invokes the
alternative construction method.


Other physical parameters
-------------------------
External parameters:
b # [...]       External magnetic field in T. Ranges are input as described in
                the section 'Vectors and Ranges', see below.
temp #          Temperature in K. The temperature affects the gap size (band
                edges) and the Mn exchange coupling. Optionally, it sets the
                thermal broadening of the density of states if the argument
                'broadening thermal' (without value) is given.
                NOTE: The gap dependence on temperature has been implemented
                since version v0.81. For older versions, the values at T = 0 K
                were used regardless of the temperature set by 'temp #'.

Specification of strain:
ignorestrain    Ignore the strain terms in the Hamiltonian. (Alias: nostrain)
strain # [# #]  Set strain value. The value may be set as a number or percentage
                (e.g., -0.002 or -0.2%). The value is interpreted as the
                'relative strain' epsilon = (a_strained / a_unstrained) - 1,
                where a_unstrained refers to the well material. (In layer stacks
                with more than three layers, the well may not be identified, and
                then this option cannot be used. Setting 'strain none' is
                equivalent to 'ignorestrain'. It is also possible to specify
                more than one argument; then the values are interpreted as
                epsilon_xx, epsilon_yy, and epsilon_zz. It is possible to enter
                - for one or two values; then the strain values corresponding to
                these components are determined from the other one(s). If
                'strain' is used together with "ignorestrain", the latter has
                priority, i.e., no strain is applied.
                NOTE: It is no longer possible to specify a strain axis. One can
                use 'strain' with two or three numerical arguments instead.
alattice #1     Set the lattice constant of the strained materials.
                (Alias: alatt, latticeconst)
NOTE: Only one of the three options 'msubst', 'alattice', 'strain #value' may be
used at once.

Material parameters:
matparam #      Modify the material parameters. The argument can either be a
                materials file or a sequence of parameter=value pairs. For the
                latter, multiple parameters must be separated by semicolons (;)
                and must be preceded by the material identifier, like so:
                matparam 'HgTe:gamma1=4.1;gamma2=0.7;CdTe:gamma1=1.6'
                Spaces are ignored and the colon (:) after the material may be
                replaced by period (.) or underscore (_). The argument must be
                quoted in the shell if it contains spaces. The material need not
                be repeated for subsequent parameters, so that in the example,
                gamma2 refers to the material HgTe. The values may be Python
                expressions, but restrictions apply (see the information for
                material parameter files). Note that all expressions must
                resolve to numerical values in order for kdotpy to run
                successfully. Multiple matparam arguments will be processed in
                order of appearance on the command line. (Alias: materialparam)

Options affecting calculation
-----------------------------
Modelling:
norb #          Number of orbitals in the Kane model. The argument can be either
                6 or 8, which means exclusion or inclusion, respectively, of the
                Gamma7 orbitals. (Alias: orbitals, orb)
                Shorthand for 'norb 6': 6o, 6orb, 6orbital, 6band, sixband
                Shorthand for 'norb 8': 8o, 8orb, 8orbital, 8band, eightband
                NOTE: Omission of this input is not permitted.
noren           Do not renormalize the parameters if using anything else than
                then eight-orbital Kane model. (Alias: norenorm,
                norenormalization, norenormalisation)
lllegacy, llfull
                Force Landau level mode to be 'legacy' or 'full'. By default,
                the Landau level calculation uses either the symbolic mode 'sym'
                if possible or the full mode if necessary. The legacy mode may
                not be used if the full mode were required. By giving 'llfull',
                one may also use the full mode if the automatically chosen 'sym'
                mode does not give the desired results. Beware that full mode is
                much heavier on resources. (kdotpy ll and kdotpy bulk-ll)
llmax           Maximum Landau level index. This has to be an integer >= 0. If
                omitted, 30 is used. Larger values yield a more complete result,
                but require more computation time and memory. (Alias: nll)

Symmetries, boundary conditions, degeneracy lifting, etc.:
noax            Include non-axial terms, i.e., break the axial symmetry. (Alias:
                noaxial, nonaxial)
ax              Use axial symmetry, i.e., the axial approximation. This is the
                default for Landau level mode (kdotpy ll and kdotpy bulk-ll).
                For dispersions, either 'ax' or 'noax' is required.
                (Alias: axial)
split #         Splitting (in meV) to lift the degeneracies. (Choose it to be
                small, e.g., 0.01.
splittype #     Type of degeneracy splitting. One of the following choices:
                  automatic  Choose sgnjz if BIA is disabled, bia if BIA is
                             enabled. (Alias: auto; default)
                  sgnjz      Use the operator sgn(J_z). Despite the fact that
                             this quantity is not a conserved quantum number, it
                             works remarkably well. This is also the default for
                             calculations without BIA.
                  sgnjz0     Use the operator sgn(J_z) at k = 0 only. This type
                             can be useful if the degeneracy is broken for
                             nonzero k as a result of some other term, for
                             example an electric field.
                  isopz      Use isoparity 'isopz'. This observable
                             distinguishes the two blocks and is a conserved
                             quantum number for symmetric geometries in many
                             circumstances. Sometimes gives cleaner results than
                             sgnjz.
                  isopzw     Use isoparity 'isopzw', applied to the well layer
                             only. While 'isopz' is not a conserved quantity for
                             asymmetric geometries (e.g., a well layer and two
                             barriers with unequal thickness), 'isopzw' can
                             remain almost conserved in that case. Due to
                             incomplete confinement in the well region, the
                             eigenvalues may deviate significantly from ±1.
                  isopzs     Use isoparity 'isopzs', applied to a region 
                             symmetric around the centre of the well layer.
                             Like 'isopzw', the observable 'isopzs' is also an
                             almost conserved quantity for asymmetric geometries
                             and tend to have eigenvalues closer to ±1, because
                             it generally takes into account the decaying wave
                             function in (a part of) the barriers.
                  bia        Modified form of sgnjz, that works better if bulk
                             inversion asymmetry (BIA) is present.
                  helical    Momentum dependent splitting, with the quantization
                             axis along the momentum direction. Zero at k = 0.
                  helical0   Same as helical, but with sgn(J_z) at k = 0.
                  cross      Momentum dependent splitting, with the quantization
                             axis perpendicular to the in-plane momentum
                             direction, i.e., kx Sy - ky Sx. Zero at k = 0.
                  cross0     Same as cross, but with sgn(J_z) at k = 0.
bia             Include bulk inversion asymmetry. Note that combination of BIA
                with 'split' may cause unwanted asymmetries, for example under
                kz -> -kz. (For kdotpy 2d, kdotpy ll, and kdotpy bulk)
ignoremagnxy    Ignore the in-plane components of the magnetic field in the
                gauge field (i.e., the 'orbital field'). The in-plane components
                still have an effect through the Zeeman and exchange couplings
                even if this option is enabled. Enabling this option 'simulates'
                the calculation before the in-plane orbital fields were
                implemented, as of version v0.58 (kdotpy 1d) or v0.74
                (kdotpy 2d), respectively. (Alias: ignoreorbxy, ignorebxy)
gaugezero #     Set the y position where the magnetic gauge potential is zero.
                The position coordinates are relative: -1.0 and +1.0 for the
                bottom and top edges of the sample, 0.0 for the center
                (default). (Alias: gauge0)
yconfinement #  Set a confinement in the y direction; local potential on the
                outermost sites, in meV. A large value (such as the default) 
                suppresses the wave function at the edges, which effectively 
                imposes Dirichlet boundary conditions (wave functions = 0). If
                the value is set to zero, the boundary conditions are
                effectively of Neumann type (derivative of wave functions = 0).
                Default: 100000 (meV) (Alias: yconf, confinement)

Diagonalization options:
neig #          Number of eigenvalues and -states to be asked from the Lanczos
                method. (Alias: neigs)
targetenergy #  Energy (meV) at which the shift-and-invert Lanczos is targeted.
                If multiple values are given, then apply Lanczos at each of
                these energies (experimental feature). If large numbers of
                eigenvalues are to be calculated (e.g., 500), it may be faster
                to calculate multiple sets with a smaller number of eigenvalues
                (e.g., 5 sets of 150). Note that the values need to be chosen
                carefully. If there is no overlap between the intervals where
                eigenvalues are found, the calculation is aborted. For smaller
                numbers of eigenvalues, it is recommended to use a single value
                for targetenergy. (Alias: e0)
energyshift #   Shift energies afterwards by this amount (in meV). Other energy
                values may still refer to the unshifted energies. This is an
                experimental feature that should be used with care. In case one
                intends to merge data (e.g., using kdotpy merge), then one
                should avoid using this option for the individual runs.
                Afterwards, this option may be used with kdotpy merge. (Alias:
                eshift)
zeroenergy      Try to align the charge-neutral gap with E = 0 meV. In
                combination with 'energyshift', align at that energy instead of
                0 meV. See also the warnings under 'energyshift #'.

System options (calculation):
cpus #          Number of parallel processes to be used. Note: The processes do
                not share memory, so it should be chosen such that the total
                memory requirement does not exceed the available memory. Can
                also be set to value 'max', 'auto' or 'automatic', for using
                all available cores; this is the default. For a single-core
                run, 'cpus 1' must be given explicitly. (Alias: cpu, ncpu)
threads #       Number of threads used per process in external libraries like
                Intel MKL (PARDISO), FEAST, LU decomposition. (Defaults to 1 if
                omitted; Alias: nthreads) 
gpus #          Number of parallel workers using the GPU when running a CUDA
                capable solver (defaults to 'cpus' if omitted. Alias: gpu,
                ngpu).
gpuselect #     NOT YET IMPLEMENTED: Select GPU(s) to be used on a multi-GPU
                environment. Currently uses first CUDA capable device. Can be
                controlled via CUDA environment variables.
showetf         Show estimated completion time in the progress monitor. When
                this option is omitted, the 'estimated time left' (ETL) is
                shown. This option is particularly convenient for longer jobs.
                Alias: monitoretf
verbose         Show more information on screen (written to stdout). Useful for
                debugging purposes.
tempout         Create a timestamped subdirectory in the output directory.
                After each step that updates a DiagDataPoint instance, it is
                'pickled' (using Python library 'pickle') and saved to disk as
                temporary binary file. This output can be loaded with the
                'resume' argument. See also the notes for 'resume' right below.
keepeivecs      Keep eigenvectors in memory for all DiagDataPoints and also for
                temporary output files (see 'tempout').
                Warning: This can drastically increase the RAM usage.
resume #1 [#2]  Path to folder created by argument 'tempout' during a previous
                script run. If a matching DiagDataPoint is found in this folder,
                it is restored into RAM and already processed calculation steps
                are skipped.
                Optionally, an integer step index may be specified to overwrite
                the step from which the process is resumed. This can be used,
                e.g. to redo the postprocessing for each DiagDataPoint, if
                eigenvectors have been saved (see 'keepeivecs').
                Note: Some command line arguments may be changed between runs
                (e.g. cpu/threads configuration) without affecting the validity
                of older DDPs for new runs. Apart from matching k & B values,
                there is no further automatic validation.
                Note: These files should be used for temporary storage and
                immediate re-use only. This is not a suitable data format for
                long-time storage. Compatibility between different versions of
                kdotpy is NOT guaranteed. For permanent storage of eigenvectors,
                enable the configuration option diag_save_binary_ddp. See also
                the security warnings for the pickle module at
                https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html.
                Usage suggestions: Resuming a preemptively canceled job (e.g.,
                due to walltime limit, out of resources, etc), testing/debugging
                restartable from partial solutions.


Options affecting output
------------------------
Observables:
obs #           Use observable # for the colouring of the plot. It must be one
                of the available observables in the data files. There is also an
                option to plot the standard deviation by prepending sigma to the
                observable. For example, sigmay will look for y and y2 in the
                list of observables, and assign plot colours according to the
                values of sqrt(<y2> - <y>^2).
                There is a special case "orbitalrgb", which colours the states
                with RGB colours determined by the (gamma6,gamma8l,gamma8h)
                expectation values.
                In kdotpy, using this option will leave only the markers to
                distinguish the data sets; without it, distinct markers and
                colours are used.
obsrange [#] #  Minimum and maximum value of the observable that determines the
                colour scale. If one value is given, it is the maximum and the
                minimum is either 0.0 or the minus the maximum, which is
                determined by whether the standard scale is symmetric or not. If
                this option is omitted, use the predefined setting for the
                colour scale (recommended). (Alias: orange, colorrange,
                colourrange)
dimful          Use dimensionful observables. Some observables, for example z
                and y, are dimensionless by default, and this option changes
                them to observables with a dimension (for example length in
                nm). This option affects output data (xml and csv) and graphics.
                Alias: dimfull
orbitalobs      Calculate the observables 'orbital[j]', that is the squared
                overlaps of the eigenstates within orbital number j, where j
                runs from 1 to norb (the number of orbitals). (For kdotpy 2d
                only.) (Alias: orbitaloverlaps, orbobs, orboverlaps)
llobs           Calculate the observables 'll[j]', that is the squared overlaps
                of the eigenstates within Landau level j, where j runs from -2
                to llmax (the largest LL index). This option is available for
                kdotpy ll in full LL mode only. (Alias: lloverlaps)
custominterfacelengthnm #
                When given calculate additional interface (character)
                observables, but within a custom length interval given by #
                (integer value in nm).
radians         Use radians for angular coordinate values. If omitted, use
                degrees (default).

Data and plot range:
erange #1 #2    Energy range, minimum and maximum value in meV. The energy range
                determines the vertical plot range in plots. It is also used as
                range for density of states calculations. For Landau level
                calculations, states outside the energy range are not saved in
                the B dependence data file.
xrange [#1] #2
                Horizontal range to display in the plot. If just one value is
                given, the range runs from 0 to the specified value.
                DEPRECATED: From version v0.95 onwards, the optional third
                argument '+' is ignored. Up to version v0.94, the extra '+' was
                used to extend the horizontal range by 5% in both directions.
                (Alias: krange, brange)
dosrange [#1] #2
                Plot range of integrated density plots. If just one value is
                given, use [0, value] for densities and [-value, value] for
                integrated densities. Omission means that the plot range is
                determined automatically. If a density unit is given, e.g.,
                'densityenm', the values are interpreted in the quantity being
                plotted. Here, large numbers (> 1000) are interpreted as having
                units of cm^-d and small numbers as nm^-d, where d is the
                dimension. (Alias: densityrange, dosmax, densitymax)
plotvar #       Plot against the given variable, instead of the default variable
                (coordinate component).
xoffset         Offsets the data points slightly in horizontal direction, so
                that (almost) degenerate points can be resolved. The direction
                (left or right) is determined by the sign of the requested
                observable.

Plot style:
plotstyle #     Choose the plot style. (Alias: plotmode). The second argument is
                one of the following plot styles.
                  normal     Unconnected data points
                  curves     Connect the data points horizontally, i.e., by band
                             index. This option replaces the old 'join' option.
                             (Alias: join)
                  horizontal Group the data points 'horizontally', but plot them
                             as separate data points.
                  auto       Use 'curves' if possible; otherwise use 'normal'.
                             (Alias: automatic)
                  spin       Use different markers based on the 'jz' observable
                             value. (NOTE: jz is the total angular momentum, not
                             the actual 'proper' spin)
                  spinxy, spinxz, spinyz
                             Like the 'normal' plot, but add arrows to indicate
                             the spin components (sx, sy), (sx, sz) or (sy, sz),
                             respectively.
                  spinxy1, spinxz1, spinyz1
                             Like spinxy, spinxz, and spinyz, but rather plot
                             directions (unit vectors) that indicate the spin
                             direction in the given plane.
                  berryxy, berryxz, berryyz, berryxy1, berryxz1, berryyz1
                             Arrows indicating Berry curvature, analogous to the
                             above spin arrow modes
                  isopz      Use different markers based on the 'isopz'
                             observable value.
                Upon omission, the default value is 'auto'.
spin            Indicate spin expectation value (up, down) with different plot
                markers/symbols.

Other plot elements, style, etc.:
labels          Display band characters or band labels at k = 0 (B = 0 if the
                horizontal axis is magnetic field) and Landau level indices,
                if applicable. This option replaces 'char', which can still be
                used as an alias.
                Contrary to older versions, the band characters are always
                computed, if applicable, not only if this option is given.
                (Alias: plotlabels, char)
title #         Assign plot title. One may use {var} to substitute the variable
                named var. In order to find out which are the available variable
                names (keys), use 'title ?' to get a list. The format syntax
                follows Python's string format function, including the format
                specification "Mini-Language"; see:
                  https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax
                Here, only named variables can be specified. Positional ones,
                like "{0}" or "{1}" are not permitted. Some special variable
                names are:
                  llayer(#)       For layer properties, append parenthesized
                                  integer index (n), e.g., llayer(1), for the
                                  property of the nth layer.
                  b_x, b_y, b_z   Cartesian vector components
                  b_phi, b_theta  Angular coordinates of a vector in degrees
                  b_len, b_abs    Vector length (len and abs are aliases)
                Alias: plottitle
titlepos #      Position of the plot title. This may be any of the following:
                  l, r, t, b;
                  left, right, top, bottom, center;
                  top-center, bottom-center;
                  tl, tr, bl, br;
                  top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
                  n, s, ne, nw, se, sw;
                  north, south, north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west.
                NOTE: left and right are synonyms to "top left" and "top right"
                NOTE: Double words can be with hyphen (top-center), underscore
                  (top_center), space ("top center"; quotes are usually needed)
                  or be joined (topcenter).
                NOTE: e, east, w, west are not legal values
                Alias: plottitlepos, titleposition, plottitleposition
legend          Include a legend in the plot. For coloured observables, this is
                a colour bar plus the indication of the observable.
                (Alias: filelegend)
legend label # [label # ...]
                If the argument 'legend' is directly followed by 'label'
                followed by the label text, use this text in the legend instead
                of the file names. The label text must be quoted on the command
                line if it contains spaces. (For kdotpy compare only.)

System options (output):
out #           Determines the names of the output files. For example, if the
                argument is "1", the program produces output1.xml, plot1.pdf,
                etc. This option also uses variable substitution using Python's
                string format function; see command 'plottitle' above. (Alias:
                outfile, outid, outputid, outputname)
outdir #        Name of the output directory. If the directory does not exist,
                try to create it. If omitted, try to write to the subdirectory
                "data" if it exists, otherwise in the current directory.
                (Alias: dir, outputdir)

Extras
------
Density of states, electrostatics, etc.:
dos             Plot density of states and integrated density of states. The
                Fermi energy and chemical potential are also indicated in the
                plots and printed to stdout, if their calculation has been
                successful. The range of validity is shown in red: In the shaded
                regions, additional states (typically at larger momentum k) are
                not taken into account in the present calculation and may cause
                the actual DOS to be higher than indicated. The validity range
                typically grows upon increasing the momentum range (argument k).
                For kdotpy ll, 'dos' will generate equal-DOS contours and put
                them in the LL plot. This is done either at a number of
                predefined densities, or at the density given by 'cardens'. For
                this script, also plot the total DOS, and the 'numeric DOS'
                (roughly the number of filled LL).
localdos        For kdotpy 2d, plot the 'local DOS', the momentum-dependent
                density of states. For kdotpy ll, plot the equivalent quantity,
                DOS depending on magnetic field. For kdotpy ll, additionally
                plot the 'differential DOS', the integrated DOS differentiated
                in the magnetic field direction.
banddos         For kdotpy 2d and kdotpy bulk, output the DOS by band. One
                obtains two csv files, for DOS and IDOS, respectively. Each
                column represents one band. (alias: dosbyband)
byblock         For kdotpy 2d and kdotpy ll, in combination with 'dos'. Give
                density of states where all states are separated by isoparity
                value (isopz = -1 or +1). Note: By nature, this function does
                not take into account spectral asymmetry of the individual
                blocks. (Alias: byisopz)
densityz        For kdotpy ll, plot density as function of z at the Fermi level,
                for all values of the magnetic field B. The output is a
                multipage pdf file and a csv file with z and B values over the
                rows and columns, respectively. The output is for one carrier
                density only.
selfcon [# [#]] Do a selfconsistent calculation of the electrostatic potential
                ("selfconsistent Hartree"). This method solves the Poisson
                equation iteratively, taking into account the occupied states in
                the well. This option also provides plots of the density as
                function of z and of the potential.
                Two optional numerical arguments: maximum number of iterations
                (default: 10) and accuracy in meV (default: 0.01)
selfconweight # Use this fractional amount to calculate the new potential in
                each iteration of the self-consistent Hartree method. This has
                to be a number between 0 and 1. The default value is 0.9. It may
                be set to a smaller value in case the iteration goes back and
                forth between two configurations, without really converging. A
                small number also slows down convergence, so the number of
                iterations may need to be increased. (Alias: scweight, scw)
vgate #         Replaced by option vtotal (alias v_outer; same functionality as
                vgate formerly) and vwell (alias v_inner). (Alias: vtb, vg)
vtotal #        Add a potential difference between top and bottom of the whole
                layer stack. The value is in meV and may be positive as well as
                negative. (Alias: v_outer, vouter)
vwell #         Add a potential difference between top and bottom of the 'well
                region'. The value is in meV and may be positive as well as
                negative. (Alias: v_inner, vinner)
vsurf # [# [#]] Add a surface/interface potential. The first argument is the
                value of the potential at the interfaces (barrier-well) in meV.
                The second parameter determines the distance (in nm) for which
                the potential decrease to 0 (default: 2.0). If the latter
                argument is q (alias: quadr, quadratic), then the potential has
                a parabolic shape. Otherwise, the decrease to 0 is linear.
                (Alias: vif)
potential # [# ...]
                Read potential from a file. The file must be in CSV format,
                i.e., with commas between the data values. Data for one-
                dimensional potentials V(z) or V(y) should be arranged in
                columns with the appropriate headings, i.e., 'z' or 'y', and
                'potential'. Data for potentials V(z, y) can be stored in a
                two-dimensional table (grid-type data) or a three-column table
                (mesh-type data). If the coordinates of the file do not align
                with those of the current calculation, then values are found by
                found by linear interpolation. Extrapolation is supported for
                one-dimensional potentials. If extrapolation is performed, a
                warning is given.
                The first argument after 'potential' must be a valid file name.
                The following arguments may be further filenames, and each
                filename may be followed by a number, interpreted as multiplier.
                For example, 'potential v1.csv -0.5 v2.csv' will yield the
                potential given by V(z) = -0.5 * V1(z) + V2(z). Multiple
                arguments 'potential' are also allowed; the results are added.
                Thus, '... potential v1.csv -0.5 ... potential v2.csv ...' is
                equivalent to the previous example.
potentialbc #   Apply custom boundary conditions for solving Poisson's equation
                in selfconsistent calculations. The argument must be a string,
                which can be one of three different formats:
                1. Input like python dict instance without any spaces:
                   "{'v1':5,'z1':-10.,'v2':7,'z2':10.}"
                   All boundary names must be given explicitly, the order is
                   irrelevant.
                2. Input single quantities as string separated with semicolon
                   without any spaces:
                   "v1=5;z1=-10.;v2=7;z2=10."
                   All boundary names must be given explicitly, the order is
                   irrelevant.
                3. Input quantity pairs as string separated with semicolon
                   without any spaces:
                   Either explicit: 'v1[-10.]=5;v2[10.]=7'
                   Or implicit: 'v[-10.]=5;v[10.]=7'
                   When using the explicit format, the order is irrelevant. When
                   using the implicit format there is an internal counter, which
                   applies an index to the quantity name, thus, the order does
                   matter.
                Here, all given examples will result in the same boundary
                condition dictionary: {'v1':5,'z1':-10.,'v2':7,'z2':10.}.
                The z-values must be given as coordinate in nm, or as one of the
                following labels:
                  bottom      Bottom end of the layer stack
                  bottom_if   Bottom interface of the "well" layer
                  mid         Center of the "well" layer
                  top_if      Top interface of the "well" layer
                  top         Top end of the layer stack
                If less than 4 key-value pairs are given, only the corresponding
                values of the automatically determined boundary conditions
                are overwritten. The ones that do not appear in the automatic
                determined boundary conditions, are ignored. This also means,
                you can decide to only overwrite the z-coordinates but keep the
                automatic determined values for 'v1', 'v2', etc.
                If two full boundary conditions are given (4 or 5 key-value
                pairs), automatic boundary conditions are always fully
                overwritten.
                NOTE: A special case for the implicit type 3 input is 'v12'.
                There you can use 'v[-10.,10.]=0;v[0.]=7' for example, which
                will result in {'v12':0,z1':-10.,'z2':10.,'v3':7,'z3':0.}.
                Another special case for the same input type is the combination
                of 'dv1' and 'v1' (or 'dv2' and 'v2'). Here you can use 
                'dv[-10.]=0;v[-10.]=7' (or 'v[-10.]=7;dv[-10.]=0'); note the
                same z-coordinates.
                (Alias: potbc)
cardens # [...] Carrier density in the well in units of e/nm^2. This value sets
                the chemical potential, i.e., "filling" of the states in the
                well. The sign is positive for electrons and negative for holes.
                (Alias: carrdens, carrierdensity, ncarr, ncar, ncarrier)
                In combination with 'kdotpy ll ... dos', specify the density at
                which the equal-density contour should be drawn. (See 'dos'
                above.)
                This option may take a single number as well as a range. This is
                an new feature that has not been fully implemented: Most
                functions involving carrier density will just take the first
                value of the range.
ndepletion # [#]   Density of the depletion layer(s) in the barrier, in units of
                   e/nm^2. The sign is positive for holes and negative for
                   electrons. The whole sample is neutral if the arguments
                   'cardens' and 'ndepletion' come with the same value. If one
                   value is specified, the charge is equally divided between
                   top and bottom barrier. If two values are specified, they
                   refer to bottom and top layer, consecutively.
                   (Alias: ndepl, ndep)
ldepletion # [#]   Length (thickness) of the depletion layers in nm. The values
                   may be numbers > 0 or "inf" or "-" for infinite (which means
                   zero charge volume density). The numbers refer to the bottom
                   and top barrier, respectively. If a single value is given,
                   use the same value for both bottom and top barrier. The
                   default (if the argument is omitted) is infinity.
                   (Alias: ldepl, ldep)
efield # #      Electric field at the bottom and top of the sample in mV/nm.
                Alternatively, one may enter a single value for either the top
                or the bottom electric field:
                  efield -- #, efield top #, efield t #, efield # top, ... (top)
                  efield # --, efield btm #, efield b #, efield # btm, ... (btm)
                If the variant with two values is used, the carrier density is
                calculated automatically. In that case, the explicit input of
                the carrier density (option 'cardens') is not permitted.
                NOTE: 'efield 0 #' is not the same as 'efield -- #'.
                NOTE: A positive electric field at the top boundary corresponds
                to a negative gate voltage, and vice versa.
berry           Calculate and plot the Berry curvature for the states close to
                the neutral gap. Also plot the integrated Berry curvature as
                function of energy. If combined with the option 'dos', then also
                plot the integrated Berry curvature as function of density. For
                LL mode (kdotpy ll), the Berry curvature is implicitly
                integrated, and the resulting output values are the Chern
                numbers of the eigenstates instead.
                (Alias: chern (for kdotpy ll only))
broadening [#] [#] [#]
                Broadening parameter for the density of the eigenstates (for
                kdotpy ll: Landau levels). The broadening is determined by a
                numerical width parameter which may be supplemented by
                additional parameters, the broadening shape, the scaling
                function, and a parameter for the Berry broadening (the latter
                for kdotpy ll only).
                The broadening types are:
                  thermal  Fermi distribution, width parameter is temperature;
                           if the width parameter is omitted, use the
                           temperature set by 'temp #'.
                  fermi    Fermi distribution, width parameter is energy
                           (alias: logistic, sech)
                  gauss    Gaussian distribution, width parameter is energy
                           (alias: gaussian, normal)
                  lorentz  Lorentzian distribution, width parameter is energy
                           (alias: lorentzian)
                  step     Dirac-delta or Heaviside-step function; if width
                           parameter is given, it is ignored (alias: delta)
                If omitted, use the default 'auto' which selects 'thermal' for
                dispersion mode and 'gauss' for LL mode.
                The scaling function determines how the width w scales as
                function of x (momentum k in nm^-1 or field B in T) (w1 is the
                input width parameter):
                  auto   Use 'const' for dispersion mode and 'sqrt' for LL mode
                         (alias: automatic)
                  const  Use constant width, w = w1
                  lin    The width scales as w = w1 x (alias: linear)
                  sqrt   The width scales as w = w1 sqrt(x)
                  cbrt   The width scales as w = w1 x^1/3
                  ^n     Where n is a number (integer, float, or fraction like
                         '1/2'). The width scales as w = w1 x^n.
                The final optional value (kdotpy ll only) is numeric (floating
                point number or a percentage like '10%') that defines a
                different broadening width for the Berry curvature/Hall
                conductivity. Floating point input is interpreted as the
                broadening width itself, a percentage defines this broadening
                width as percentage of the density broadening width. The
                Berry/Hall broadening inherits the shape and scaling function 
                from the density broadening.
                Multiple 'broadening' arguments may be given; these will then
                be iteratively applied to the (integrated) DOS, in the given
                order. NOTE: Due to limitations of the numerical integration
                (convolution operation), combining multiple broadening functions
                may lead to larger numerical errors than a single broadening
                function. The convolution operation is commutative only up to
                numerical errors, so changing the order may lead to slight
                differences in the result.
berrybroadening [#] [#] [#]
                Broadening parameter for the Berry curvature/Hall conductivity.
                The syntax is the same as the ordinary broadening parameter.
                Also multiple ones can be combined. Note that it is not
                permitted to combine 'berrybroadening' with a 'broadening' with
                argument with a extra numerical argument, for example,
                'broadening 0.5 gauss 10%'. For kdotpy ll only. (Alias:
                hallbroadening, chernbroadening)
dostemp #       Temperature used for thermal broadening of the DOS. This input
                is equivalent to 'broadening # thermal const' (but only one of
                these may be used at a time). This temperature may be different
                than the temperature set by 'temp' on the command line (which
                controls the temperature in the exchange coupling, for example).
                If neither 'dostemp' nor 'broadening' is given, no broadening is
                applied. (NOTE: This behaviour has changed since v0.85.)
                This option is especially useful for calculating the DOS with
                the re-plotting scripts: In that case, 'temp' has no effect,
                because the value is read from the data files, whereas 'dostemp'
                *can* be used to set the thermal broadening.
                (Alias: tbroadening, tempbroadening)
hall            Shortcut that activates all options for calculation of Hall
                conductivity with kdotpy ll. It is equivalent to the
                combination 'berry dos localdos broadening 0.5 10%'. The default
                value of the broadening can be overridden with the explicit
                option 'broadening # [#]' combined with 'hall'. This applies to
                berrybroadening as well.
ecnp #          Set charge-neutral energy (zero density) to this energy. The
                value determines the point where the density is zero. This
                affects integrated density of states in dispersion mode only.
                In order to manipulate band indices by determining the zero gap,
                use the 'bandalign' argument. (Alias: cnp, efermi, ef0)
densoffset #    Set a density offset. Basically, this number is added to the
                integrated DOS / carrier density in the selfconsistent
                calculation. The value is in units of charge density and can be
                interpreted as free carriers inside the quantum well. (Alias:
                noffset, ncnp)
cardensbg #     Set a background density. Calculates a rectangular carrier
                distribution for this number, which is then added to the carrier
                distribution used in solving Poisson's equation. The value is in
                units of charge density and can be interpreted as immobile
                background charge.
idosoffset #    Set an offset to the density of states, in appropriate DOS
                units. This option is identical to 'densoffset' up to a factor
                of 4 pi^2. (Alias: dosoffset)
NOTE: Most of these options are currently available with kdotpy 2d only. Some
can be used in kdotpy ll, which is explicitly indicated above.

Other extras:
plotfz [#]      See comments "Plotting z-dependent values" below. (Alias:
                plotqz)
plotwf [# ...]  Plot wave functions. The extra arguments are the plot style for
                the wave function plot and the locations (momenta) for which the
                plots are made. See also comments "Plotting wave functions"
                below.
overlaps        Calculate overlaps between the eigenstates with those at zero
                momentum. By default, the overlaps are calculated with E1+/-,
                H1+/-, H2+/-, and L1+/-. A nice visualization can be obtained
                with 'obs subbandrgb', which assigns colours depending on the
                overlaps with E1, H1, and H2. A visualization with different
                bands can be obtained by using 'obs subbandh1e1e2', for example,
                where the observable id ends with >= 3 pairs of subband
                identifiers. Each subband identifier is a band character ('e',
                'l', or 'h' followed by a number) denoting a pair of subbands,
                a single subband (the previous followed by '+' or '-'), or a
                band index (a signed integer preceded by 'b' or parenthesized,
                e.g., 'b+2', '(-25)').
                (kdotpy 2d and kdotpy ll)
currents        Calculate currents, i.e., the expectation values of the operator
                derivative dH/dk_x and dH/dk_y. The expectation values are saved
                as the observables 'dhdkx' and 'dhdky' (and as 'vx' and 'vy', in
                velocity units). If a suitable observable is given by the
                argument 'obs' (one that is expressed as expectation value of a
                matrix operator), then also calculate the expectation values of
                the symmetrized product {dH/dk_i, O} / 2 (with i = x,y). The
                corresponding expectation values can also be accessed as
                observables, for example 'dhdkx_sz' if 'currents' is given
                together with 'obs sz'. Note that 'currents ... obs dhdkx_sz'
                can be used to calculate that observable, and at the same time
                use it for the colour scale in a dispersion plot.
                (kdotpy 2d)
transitions [#1 #2] [#3]
                Calculate and plot transitions between levels. There can be up
                to 3 optional numerical arguments: The first pair is the energy
                range where transitions are calculated. If omitted, calculate
                transitions between all calculated states (which may be
                controlled with 'neig' and 'targetenergy'). The last argument is
                the square-amplitude threshold above which the transitions are
                taken into account. If omitted, the program uses the default
                value 0.05.
minmax          Output the minimum, maximum, and zero-momentum energy of each
                subband. (kdotpy 2d and kdotpy bulk)
extrema         Output the local extrema of each subband. The output contains
                the type (min or max), the momentum, the energy, and an estimate
                for the effective inertial mass along the momentum direction.

bhz [# ...]     Do a Löwdin expansion around zero momentum in order to derive a
                simplified Hamiltonian in the subband basis. This is the
                generalization of the BHZ model. The arguments specify the
                number of subbands in the basis ('A bands') and (optionally) how
                many bands should be treated perturbatively. The argument
                pattern is one of:
                  #na                  Number of A bands
                  #na_b #na_a          Number of A bands below and above CNP
                  #nl #na #nu          Number of lower perturbative bands,
                                       A bands, and upper perturbative bands
                  #nl #na_a #na_b #nu  Number of lower perturbative bands,
                                       A bands below and above CNP, and upper
                                       perturbative bands
                  #a_labels            Labels of A bands, e.g., E1, H1+, H1-.
                  #nl #a_labels #nu    Number of lower perturbative bands,
                                       labels of A bands, labels of lower
                                       perturbative bands.
                If the number of perturbative bands is omitted, take the maximum
                possible number of bands that are localized in the well.
                The #a_labels argument may contain subband characters with or
                without sign. Band indices with explicit sign (e.g., -1, +2) may
                also be used.
                If 'bhz' is given without arguments, 'bhz 2 2' is implied. This
                is the standard four-band BHZ model.
kbhz #          Set the reference momentum for the BHZ (Löwdin) expansion. The
                argument refers to a momentum value on the kx axis. This
                experimental option can be used for expansions around nonzero
                momentum. Please consider the results with care, as they are not
                always meaningful. (Alias: bhzk, bhzat)
symmetrytest    Analyze the symmetries of the eigenvalues and observables under
                various transformations in momentum space. This results in a
                list of compatible representations of the maximal point group
                Oh, from which the program tries to determine the actual
                symmetry group (point group at the Gamma point).
                NOTE: For a reliable result, the momentum grid must be
                compatible with the symmetries; a cartesian grid should be used
                for cubic symmetry, a polar or cylindrical grid otherwise.
                For kdotpy 2d, kdotpy bulk: full analysis.
                For kdotpy 1d, kdotpy merge: partial analysis (full analysis
                to be implemented).
symmetrize      Extend the data in the momentum space by symmetrization. For
                example, a 1D range for positive k can be extended to negative
                k, or a 2D range defined in the first quadrant can be extended
                to four quadrants. The extension is done by taking the known
                eigenvalues and observables and transforming them appropriately.
                NOTE: The algorithm relies on some pre-defined transformation
                properties of the observables, and should be used with care. A
                cross-check with a symmetric range and 'symmetrytest' is
                advised.

Vectors and ranges
------------------
The following 'patterns' apply to the input of the vector-valued quantities 'k'
(momentum) as well as 'b' (magnetic field). The examples are given in terms of
'k', but extend also to the case 'b'.

The following combinations of components can be input:
k               Vectors along default axis (kx for k, bz for b), value is length
kx              Vectors along x axis
ky              Vectors along y axis
kz              Vectors along z axis
kx ky           Vectors with coordinates (x, y) in a cartesian 2D grid
kx ky kz        Vectors with coordinates (x, y, z) in a cartesian 3D grid
k kphi          Vectors in a polar representation
k kphi z        Vectors in cylindrical coordinates
k ktheta kphi   Vectors in spherical coordinates (theta is polar angle, phi is
                azimuth angle)
k kdir          Vectors along a constant vector (parametrized as spherical and
                polar coordinates in 3D and 2D, respectively)
k kperp         Vectors in two perpendicular directions (first coordinate
                generally refers to the default axis)
k kperp kphi    Vectors in two perpendicular directions, then rotated by an
                angle phi (in xy plane) (POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE)
NOTE: The polar and cylindrical coordinates are parametrized as
  (x, y) = (r cos phi, r sin phi)
and
  (x, y, z) = (r cos phi, r sin phi, z),
respectively.  The spherical coordinates are parametrized as
  (x, y, z) = (r sin theta cos phi, r sin theta sin phi, r cos theta).
Angles are given in degrees, unless the argument 'radians' is included.
Negative radii are allowed, which is useful if one calculates along one axis
with 'k -0.2 0.2 / 10 kphi 45', for example.
NOTE: The order of the arguments is irrelevant. If doing a 2D or 3D range, then
the coordinates are iterated through in a 'natural' order, e.g., first x, then
y, or r, then theta, then phi.
NOTE: For polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, one may input a single
value or a one-dimensional range using a cartesian component combined with the
angle(s). Examples: kx kphi, kx kphi ktheta, kz ktheta. This yields vectors at
the given angle where the radius is scaled such that the given cartesian
component has the given value(s). The angle must be single-valued, and singular
angles lead to an error. The values are stored in the angular representation,
and in order to get a plot in a cartesian component, use the option 'plotvar'.
NOTE: The argument kdir is special in the sense that it does not define a
range, but a constant vector. Its argument must always be a triplet of
integers, for example 'kdir 1 1 0' or 'kdir 110'. The latter short version can
be used if all components are between -9 and 9. There are several restrictions,
e.g., in 2D mode one cannot have a nonzero z component. The resulting
coordinates are parametrized in spherical (3D) or polar (2D) representation.

Specification of values and ranges:
k #             Single value
k #1*#2         Single value #1 * #2, where #1 is an integer, and #2 could be
                seen as a step size
k #1/#2     (a) If #1 float, #2 float: #1 is maximum, #2 is step size.
                  k = 0, 1*#2, 2*#2, ..., #1
            (b) If #1 float, #2 int  : #1 is maximum, #2 is number of steps.
                  k = 0, (1/#2)*#1, (2/#2)*#1, ..., #1.
k #1 #2/#3  (a) If #1 float, #2 float, #3 float: #1 is minimum, #2 is maximum,
                #3 is step size
                  k = #1, #1 + 1*#3, #1 + 2*#3, ..., #2.
            (b) If #1 float, #2 float, #3 integer: #1 is minimum, #2 is maximum,
                #3 is number of steps
                  k = #1, #1 + (1/#3)*#2, #1 + (2/#3)*#2, ..., #2.
k #1 #2 #3/#4   Single momentum value "#3 of #4 steps from #1 to #2". #3 and #4
                are integers.
                  k = #1 + (#2 - #1) * #3 / #4
NOTE: For the cases where a single slash is followed by an integer, doubling the
slash will do 'quadratic stepping'. For example: "k 0 1 // 10" yields the
momentum values 0.0, 0.01, 0.04, 0.09, ..., 0.81, 1.0. This option is especially
useful with the variable 'b' in Landau-level calculations.

Some examples:
k -0.2 0.2 / 10              Values along the kx axis (default axis for k)
kx 0.1 ky 0.1                Single (kx, ky). (Alias: k # kperp #)
k 0.2 kphi 45                Single k value (k cos(phi), k sin(phi)).
kx -0.2 0.2 / 10 ky 0.1      Range in kx direction, for single ky value.
k -0.2 0.2 / 10 kperp 0.1    Equivalent to previous example
k -0.2 0.2 / 10 kphi 45      Range of (k cos(phi), k sin(phi)) with a range of
                             radii k.
kx -0.2 0.2 / 10 kphi 45     Range of (k cos(phi), k sin(phi)) such that the kx
                             values run from -0.2 to 0.2. Only a single value
                             for phi is allowed. Singular values (e.g., 90) are
                             forbidden.
b 0 1 / 10                   Values along the bz axis (default axis for b),
                             equally spaced, i.e., 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... 0.9,
                             1.0.
b 0 1 // 10                  Values along the bz axis, quadratically spaced,
                             i.e., 0.0, 0.01, 0.04, 0.09, ... 0.81, 1.0
kx 0 0.2 / 10 ky 0 0.2 / 10  2D scan of (kx, ky)
k 0 0.2 / 10 kphi 0 90 / 6   2D scan over radii k and angles phi
b 0 0.2 / 10 btheta 60 bphi 90
                             Vectors with a range of lengths at spherical angles
                             theta = 60 degrees and phi = 90 degrees.
kx 0 0.2 / 10 ky 0 0.2 / 10 kz 0 0.2 / 10
                             3D scan over kx, ky, kz
k 0 0.2 / 10 ktheta 0 90 / 6 kphi 0 90 / 12
                             3D scan over spherical coordinates
k 0 0.2 / 10 kdir 1 1 1      Range of values parallel to vector (1,1,1)
k 0 0.2 / 10 kdir 111        Range of values parallel to vector (1,1,1)
k -0.2 0.2 / 10 kperp 0.2 kphi 45
                             Range of (k cos(phi), k sin(phi)) + (-kperp
                             sin(phi), kperp cos(phi)) with a range of values k.
                             (POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE)

Extras in detail
================

Plotting wave functions
-----------------------
The band structure scripts (kdotpy 1d, kdotpy 2d, etc.) have the option to plot
the wave functions together with the other (dispersion/dependence) plots. This
is done with the argument 'plotwf', which have some additional options that
determine the plot style and the locations (momenta or magnetic fields) at which
the plots are made. There can be only one plot style argument, but multiple
location arguments. The extra arguments can be omitted, in which case the
default plot style and locations are used.

Plot styles (1D):
z      As function of z, at y = 0 (at the middle of the sample), i.e.,
       psi(z, 0). Decomposition into orbitals. (Alias: 1d)
y      Absolute-squared, as function of y, integrated over the z coordinate,
       i.e., |psi|^2(y) = int |psi(z, y)|^2 dz. Decomposition into orbitals
       and optionally subbands.
zy     Absolute-squared, as function of (z, y), i.e., |psi(z, y)|^2, summed over
       all orbitals. (Alias: yz, default)
color  Absolute-squared, with different colours for the orbitals, as function of
       (z, y). (Alias: colour, byband, by_band)

Plot styles (2D, LL):
separate  As function of z, with different curves for each orbital. (Alias: all,
          default)
together  Absolute-squared, as function of z, together in one plot.

Locations (momentum values k [or B in LL mode]):
zero      At k = 0. (Alias: 0)
min       At the smallest k.
max       At the largest k.
mid       The k value in the center of the momentum range.
minmax    At the smallest and the largest k. (Equivalent to 'min max')
all       Plot wavefunctions for all k. Warning: This can lead to very large
          output and long postprocessing times.
three     At the smallest, largest, and central k value. (Equivalent to
          'min mid max'; alias: 3, halves)
five      Like three, but in addition at the quarters, i.e., 1/4 and 3/4 along
          the momentum range. (Alias: 5, quarters)
#         (any number other than '0', '3', '5') At this value.

Sets of multiple momentum values take effect in 2D only. In 1D, take the first
or the smallest value.
If calculating over a multi-dimensional momentum grid, the locations apply to
each component separately. Any value that would not be in the range (e.g., 'mid'
in a range with an even number of values) is skipped. It is not possible to
specify different values for different dimensions, although lengths and angles
are easily separated by their different orders of magnitude, for example:
'plotwf 0 0.1 45' would match polar momentum values (0, 0 deg), (0, 45 deg),
(0.1, 0 deg), and (0.1, 45 deg).
In LL mode, the locations are interpreted in terms of magnetic fields.
Depending on the configuration value 'wf_location_exact_match', match the
locations exactly (if true; default value) and skip the locations if no match is
found, or find the nearest value (if false).
If symmetrization is used (command line argument 'symmetrize'), then wave
functions output happens only at the points of the original grid, i.e., where
the diagonalization has been done explicitly. At extrapolated points not present
in the original grid, no output will be given.

Additional comments:
If erange is set, plot the wave functions in this energy range only.

For plot styles 'zy' and 'color', the outputs will be files with names
wf_xxmeV_yyy.png or wf_xxmeV_yyy.pdf. If the 'convert' command is present, a
multipage PDF is created. The separate files will not be deleted. It may be
advisable to clean up files from earlier runs first.

For the other plot styles, the result will be a single PDF file. This will be a
multipage PDF if multiple plots are concerned. In the rare case that the
creation of a multipage PDF page is not possible, multiple separate PDFs are
made.


Plotting z-dependent values
---------------------------
For the 1d and 2d scripts, the option 'plotfz' outputs plots of some z-dependent
parameters that determine the Hamiltonian. The values are also written to a CSV
format data file.

The plots contain:
qz-bands.pdf       E_c and E_v               (conduction and valence band edges)
qz-fgammakappa.pdf F, gamma_{1,2,3}, kappa   (miscellaneous band parameters)
qz-exchange.pdf    y N_0 alpha, y N_0 beta   (paramagnetic exchange energies)

The option 'legend' will include a legend in these plots (recommended). The
filenames are also affected by the option 'out'.


BHZ calculation
---------------
Approximations to the BHZ model are done by invoking kdotpy 2d with the extra
option 'bhz'.

The number of bands in the perturbation theory is input using the argument
'bhz', which may take up to four even-integer parameters:
1. kdotpy 2d [...] bhz #na
2. kdotpy 2d [...] bhz #na_b #na_a
3. kdotpy 2d [...] bhz #nl #na #nu
4. kdotpy 2d [...] bhz #nl #na_b #na_a #nu
5. kdotpy 2d [...] bhz #a_labels
6. kdotpy 2d [...] bhz #nl #a_labels #nu
Here, #na determines the number of 'A' bands, i.e., the bands which are treated
exactly at k = 0. With #na_b and #na_a one can specify the number of A bands
above and below the (charge-neutral) gap. The parameters #nl and #nu determine
the number of 'lower' and 'upper' bands that are taken into account
perturbatively. If not given (cases 1., 2., 5.), then take the maximum possible
number of bands that are localized in the well. In the other cases, when
non-localized bands are included, a warning is issued, but the calculation will
continue (if no other errors occur).
The A bands may also be given as a sequence of labels #a_labels (cases 5. and
6.). For example, 'bhz 6 E1 H1 2' is the usual four-band BHZ model with 6 and 2
bands taken into account perturbatively below and above. In this case, the order
of the basis in the output is the order of bands given as input. It is possible
to distinguish between the two spin components (e.g., by using input 'bhz 6 E1+
E1- H1+ H1- 2', but this is not necessary. A band label without + or - implies
the two respective components.
For the A bands, one may also use band indices instead of or in combination with
band labels. Band indices are input as integers with signs, for example
'bhz 6 -2 -1 +1 +2 2'. The explicit + sign for positive band indices is
required. This option may be useful if band characters are not available, for
example at finite magnetic field.

The default value is 'bhz 2 2', i.e., the standard four-band BHZ model. Another
typical setting is 'neig 50 bhz E1 H1 H2' for a six-band model.

There is an experimental option 'kbhz #' (alias 'bhzk', 'bhzat') for doing a
BHZ-like calculation (Löwdin perturbation) around nonzero momentum. Presently,
only points on the x axis are supported. The output needs to be considered with
care. Please test and report.


kdotpy merge and kdotpy compare
===============================

The separate command kdotpy merge provides the ability to create one plot from
data points scattered over different files.
The command kdotpy compare takes multiple files and plots the data in one plot,
distinguishing between the data sets using different markers and/or colours.

They are called as:
$ kdotpy merge option1 arg1 option2 arg2 arg3 file1 file2 ...
$ kdotpy compare option1 arg1 option2 arg2 arg3 file1 file2 ...
where file1, file2, ... are the data (xml) files.
Note: In case any of the options or arguments conflict with existing file or
directory names, one can put '--' in front of the file names, like:
$ kdotpy merge option1 arg1 option2 arg2 arg3 -- file1 file2 ...
The '--' signals that following arguments may be read as file names and
preceding arguments should not.

The additional options are:
sortdata        Sort the data by momentum (k) or parameter (B) value. This will
                succeed only if the data set is on a grid.
select #1 #2    Select a subset of the grid. The first argument #1 must be a
                momentum component (e.g., k, kx, kphi) and the second argument
                #2 must be a numerical value. This selects all data points for
                which the momentum component is equal to #2.
bandalign [# [#]]
                Try to (re)connect the data points, by (re)assigning the band
                indices. The first optional argument determines the 'anchor
                energy', i.e., the energy at k = 0 (or B = 0) that separates
                bands with positive and negative indices. If the second argument
                is given, treat the gap at the given energy as having this
                index.  Omission of the first argument causes the anchor energy
                to be determined automatically. Explicit specification of this
                energy is necessary only if the automatic method appears to
                fail, or if the correct assignment of the band indices is
                important (e.g., for calculation density of states). When the
                second argument is omitted, use the default gap index 0.
                Alternatively, 'bandalign filename.csv' may be used to use the
                energies in the csv file in order to do assign the band indices.
                The format is that of 'dispersion.byband.csv', i.e., energies
                of each of the bands in columns. This option may be used to
                manually 'correct' an incorrect band connection result.
                If the data is not sorted (as function of k or B), then try to
                sort the data automatically before applying the band alignment
                algorithm. (Alias: reconnect)
vs              For kdotpy compare: Separate files into sets. Basically, apply
                the functionality of kdotpy merge to the comparison script.
                Example:
                $ kdotpy compare [options] f1 f2 f3 vs f4 f5
                This compares the combination of files f1, f2 and f3 to the
                combination of files f4 and f5. There can be more than two sets
                by using vs more than once, and each set can have an arbitrary
                number of files.
                If not given, compare the specified files one-by-one.
writecsv        For kdotpy merge: Write csv output (dispersion or B dependence)
                based on merged data.

Note:
The options for kdotpy 1d and kdotpy 2d that affect plotting, such as 'erange',
also apply to the plots made by kdotpy merge.


kdotpy batch
============

kdotpy batch is an auxiliary subprogram for running any of the other scripts in
batch mode, i.e., many runs in sequence, with a variation in the parameters. The
philosophy is more or less like a shell (bash) script, but with a bit more
'decoration' and with proper handling of runs in parallel.

The general syntax is best illustrated with an example:
$ kdotpy batch [opts] @x 5.0 9.0 / 4 @y [CdTe, HgTe, HgCdTe 68%]
    do kdotpy 2d [opts] llayer 10 @x 10 mater HgCdTe 68% @y HgCdTe 68%
    out -@0of@@

What happens is the following: The command following the argument 'do'
('kdotpy 2d' in this case) is executed iteratively with '@x' replaced by 5.0,
6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0, and '@y' by the values 'CdTe', 'HgTe', and 'HgCdTe 68%'.
In this example, 'kdotpy 2d' will be executed 15 times. The '@0' and '@@' are
replaced by counting and total value respectively. Thus, the output files will
be numbered as '1of15', '2of15', etc.

The variables 'x' and 'y' have been specified before the 'do'. In this case, 'x'
is defined with a range specification (same syntax as the 'Specification of
momenta', see above) and 'y' with a list specification, within brackets [] and
separated by commas.

Overview of the replacements:
  @@              Total number of iterations
  @0              Iteration counter, starting at 1
  @1, @2, ...     Iteration counter for each @ variable, in order of their input
                  before the 'do'.
  @variablename   Value of variable with name 'variablename'
  @{variablename} Value of variable with name 'variablename'
NOTE: Variable names may not be a one-digit number or @. The variable name may
also not contain curly brackets, { or }. Other than these restrictions,
everything is allowed. In the command after 'do', please make sure that variable
names do not 'clash': For example, if both @x and @xy are used, in any @xy after
'do', the @x may be replaced first, leading to unexpected results. This may be
prevented by using the @{variablename} pattern consistently.

Options (to be specified before 'do'):
dryrun           Display the scripts that would be executed, following the
                 replacements of the @ variables. However, do not actually run
                 them.
groupiter [# ...]
                 Link the iterators for the specified variables together,
                 similar to the Python zip() function. For example,
                 'kdotpy batch @x [0, 1] @y [100, 200] groupiter x y do ...'
                 would yield the combinations (x, y) = (0, 100) and (1, 200)
                 only. The additional arguments for groupiter must be variable
                 names (without the @) or integer indices (counting from 1). If
                 the additional argument is omitted, link all variables.
                 Multiple groupiter arguments may be combined to form multiple
                 groups. Within each group, the variables must have an equal
                 number of values. (Alias: zipiter, zip)
cpu #            Specify number of threads/processes that should run in
                 parallel. This option takes into account the 'cpu' option in
                 the invocation of kdotpy that is run (i.e., specified after
                 'do') in order to determine the number of jobs that can run in
                 parallel. For example,
                 'kdotpy batch cpu 6 ... do kdotpy 2d ... cpu 2'
                 will cause three (= 6 / 2) instances of kdotpy 2d to be run in
                 parallel.
proc #           Number of parallel processes to be run. This option does not
                 take into account what is specified after 'do'. For example:
                 'kdotpy batch proc 6 ... do kdotpy 2d ... cpu 2'
                 will cause six instances of kdotpy 2d to be run in parallel,
                 and each instance might run two processes/threads in parallel.

NOTE: If both 'cpu' and 'proc' are not given, default to the maximum number of 
available CPUs. If also the command does not specify the number of CPUs, then
run the command sequentially with each running at the maximum number of CPUs.

NOTE: The console output (stdout and stderr streams) of the individual kdotpy
commands is 'dumped' into the files stdout.1.txt, stdout.2.txt, ... and
stderr.1.txt, stderr.2.txt, ... . The kdotpy batch subprogram writes its own
information to the standard stdout and stderr streams.


Configuration option reference
==============================

The configuration file (typically $HOME/.kdotpy/kdotpyrc) hosts a number of
configuration options that are meant to be 'semi-static', e.g., configurable
options that need to be changed occasionally or even only once, as opposed to
parameters that are specified with every run.

NOTE: If the configuration file is unavailable, but there is an old
configuration file at '$HOME/.hgmnte/hgmnterc', the latter file will be copied
from the old location to the new one. This should happen automatically the first
time any kdotpy script is run after the renaming. You should remove your old
configuration directory '$HOME/.hgmnte' manually in order to get rid of the
warnings.

If desired, custom configuration can be loaded from the command line in two
ways:
config file.cfg     Where 'file.cfg' is a file name. This loads custom
                    configuration values from the given file. If the file with
                    the given name is not found in the working directory, then
                    also search in the configuration directory (usually
                    ~/.kdotpy).
config "fig_hsize=150; fig_vsize=100"
                    Take the given keys and values directly from the command
                    line. The "key=value" pairs must be separated by semicolons
                    (;). In almost all cases, it is necessary to enclose the
                    list of key-value pairs in double quotes "like this" or
                    single quotes 'like this'.
It is possible to combine multiple instances, for example:
  config file1.cfg config "fig_hsize=150; fig_vsize=100" config file2.cfg
The files/inputs are processed from left to right: newer values override
existing values.

The configuration takes following precedence:
1. Custom value (from custom configuration file or command line) if set. If not
   set, then
2. Values from the loaded XML files (kdotpy merge and kdotpy compare only);
   latest loaded file takes highest precedence. If not applicable or not set,
   then
3. Initial value (from $HOME/.kdotpy/kdotpyrc) if set. If not set, then
4. Default value (hardcoded into the program).

Currently, the following options have a meaning:
diag_solver        The implementation of the function that does the matrix
                   diagonalization. Possible values:
                     feast       Use FEAST algorithm (Intel MKL). If this
                                 package is not available, fall back to eigsh.
                                 Can be tried as an alternative if eigsh fails,
                                 e.g., for very large matrices (dim > 5e6).
                     eigsh       Use eigsh from SciPy sparse matrix library.
                     superlu_eigsh
                                 Same as eigsh, but SuperLU is requested
                                 explicitly. Enables detailed timing statistics,
                                 as with other custom eigsh solvers.
                     umfpack_eigsh
                                 Like eigsh, but uses umfpack instead of SuperLU
                                 for matrix inversion. Recommended for large
                                 matrices. Falls back to SuperLU if Scikit
                                 UMFPACK is not available. REQUIRES available
                                 scikit-umfpack and a suitable SciPy version.
                     pardiso_eigsh
                                 Like umfpack_eigsh, but uses Intel MKL PARDISO
                                 instead. REQUIRES pyMKL package.
                     cupy_eigsh  Alternative implementation of the eigsh
                                 solver in python. Uses CUDA libraries for
                                 Lanczos iteration (on GPU) and PARDISO to
                                 SuperLU for matrix inversion, depending on
                                 availability. REQUIRES CUDA libraries and
                                 CuPy package.
                     jax_eigh    Uses the JAX eigh solver. First converts
                                 sparse matrices to dense. Extremely memory
                                 inefficient! Fails if not enough VRAM
                                 can be allocated. Use the 'gpus' option
                                 to reduce the number of workers on the GPU
                                 if this happens. This solver is best suited
                                 for a large number of 'neig'. REQUIRES jax
                                 package.
                     auto        Decision based on script type. Uses
                                 'pardiso_eigsh' for kdotpy 1d if available,
                                 otherwise uses 'eigsh' for all scripts.
                                 Suggests alternative solvers if they could
                                 be faster. (default; alias: automatic)
diag_solver_worker_type
                   Sets the parallelization strategy for solver workers.
                   Options:
                     process    Use a process pool for solver workers.
                                Recommended strategy for most solvers.
                     thread     Use a thread pool in the main process for solver
                                workers. Recommended for CUDA based solver
                                'cupy_eigsh' for optimal GPU workload.
                     none       No parallel execution of the solve step. Every
                                solve task is executed serially in the main
                                thread. Recommended for debugging.
                     auto       Decision based on 'diag_solver'.
                                (default; alias: automatic)
diag_solver_cupy_dtype
                   Sets the data type for the cupy solver. Options:
                     single     Uses complex numbers with single float
                                precision. This leads to a large speed boost on
                                GPUs with TensorCores. Precision of eigenvalues
                                is worse (on the order of 10 µeV).
                     double     Uses complex numbers with double float
                                precision. Solution speed and precision of
                                eigenvalues comparable to other solvers.
                                Medium speed boost expected on GPUs with modern
                                FP64-TensorCores (e.g. Nvidia A100). (default)
diag_solver_cupy_iterations
                   Maximum number of Lanczos iteration steps for both precision
                   options. If number of iterations is exceeded, fall back to
                   better precision first or CPU based solver next. (default: 5)
diag_solver_cupy_gemm_dim_thr
                   Maximum dimension for matrix matrix multiplication in single
                   precision mode. If problem size exceeds this value, the
                   solution is split into multiple smaller problem sets. Smaller
                   values can lead to worse solution speeds, larger values can
                   lead to more numerical problems and fallback to slower double
                   precision solver. The default value is 4e6, from initial
                   tests.
diag_save_binary_ddp
                   Whether and how to save intermediate binary files for each
                   DiagDataPoint (diagonalization data point). Possible choices:
                     npz     The NumPy (compressed) binary file format; see
                             https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.lib.format.html
                             (alias: numpy)
                     h5      HDF5 data format. This requires the Python module
                             h5py to be installed. See https://docs.h5py.org
                             (alias: hdf5)
                     false   Do not save intermediate files (default)
                   Note: This configuration value is independent from the
                   command line option 'tempout'. The npz and hdf5 formats are
                   meant for permanent data storage, the 'tempout' files are
                   only safe for immediate re-use and should not be used for
                   long-term storage.
diag_save_binary_ddp_delete_eivec
                   Whether to remove the eigenvector data from memory if binary
                   files have been written with 'diag_save_binary_ddp' enabled.
                   Functions needing eigenvector data at a later stage read the
                   data from disk rather than from memory. This option is useful
                   for very large eigenvector sizes or having to analyze the
                   eigenvectors for a large number of data points. Enabling this
                   option reduces memory consumption, but also increases
                   processing time as reading from disk is slower than from
                   memory. This option affects kdotpy-1d only. (boolean value;
                   default: false)
err_unexpected_ignore
                   In case an unexpected error is caught in an optional step of
                   a script, the code may continue with further steps instead of
                   terminating early. (default: true)
err_unexpected_print_traceback
                   In case an unexpected error was suppressed with
                   'err_unexpected_ignore', print a full error traceback to
                   stderr, as if the error was not caught (but continue
                   running). (default: true)
task_retries       Number of times a task is restarted after any exception has
                   been raised. (default: 2)
tasks_grouped      If set to true, all steps for a single DiagDataPoint are
                   executed within the same worker/thread with the settings for
                   the solve_ham step. Compared to the default mode (false),
                   this involves less inter-worker data transfers (via
                   "pickling") that could give rise to issues with very large
                   eigenvectors. As such, the worker communication behaves
                   similar to kdotpy versions < v0.72. (default: false)
numpy_printprecision
                   The number of digits of precision for NumPy array floating
                   point output. (This output is used in verbose mode mostly.)
                   The value is passed to numpy.set_printoptions(), see
                   https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.set_printoptions.html.
                   The value has to be an integer >= 0. The number of digits
                   shown does not exceed the number needed to uniquely define
                   the values, e.g., 17 digits for 64-bit floating point
                   numbers. (default: 6)
numpy_linewidth    Sets the (approximate) line width for NumPy array output.
                   (This output is used in verbose mode mostly.) The value is
                   passed to numpy.set_printoptions(), see
                   https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.set_printoptions.html.
                   The value has to be an integer >= 0. The output is always at
                   least one column, so small values may be exceeded.
                   (default: 200)
job_monitor_limit  If the number of data points is smaller than this value, show
                   the full job monitor with information about the intermediate
                   steps. Otherwise, show the simple in-line progress indicator.
                   For the value 0, always show the simple progress indicator.
                   (default: 101)
material_file_filter
                   Filter for the material files in the material file folder
                   (~/.kdotpy/materials). This can be a single pattern or a
                   comma separated list of patterns, which may contain the
                   wildcards ? and * to match multiple files. Recursive matching
                   with ** is not supported. The pattern also may not match
                   files outside the material file folder; however, its
                   subfolders are accepted. Files that match more than one
                   pattern in the list are only included once. If no filter is
                   given (empty string, which is the default), then no filtering
                   is done and all files in the materials folder are loaded;
                   this behaviour is equivalent to the filter '*'.
                   Note: This option may also be used to control the order in
                   which the material files are loaded. For example, if the file
                   'znte' needs to be loaded before all other files, the filter
                   'znte,*' will achieve this. (The default material file is
                   always loaded first, regardless of the filter.) A filter
                   without wildcards, for example 'znse,znte,mnte', is just a
                   list of files that will be loaded in that order. A filter
                   like '*.mat' would allow to use a custom extension '.mat' for
                   the material files. (default: (empty string))
band_align_exp     Value of the exponent in the minimization function of the
                   'error' in the band alignment algorithm. A numerical value
                   equal to e means that sum(|DeltaE|^e) is minimized.
                   Alternatively, if the special value 'max' is used, then the
                   minimization function is max(|DeltaE|). (default: 4)
band_align_ndelta_weight
                   Coefficient of the penalty for reduction of the number of
                   bands in the band alignment algorithm. The higher this value,
                   the more the algorithm 'resists' changes in the number of
                   bands. The value may not be negative (however, 0 is allowed),
                   and too high values should be avoided. It is recommended to
                   use the default value unless the band alignment algorithm
                   does not proceed correctly. (default: 20.0)
band_char_node_threshold
                   In the band character algorithm, this value times the
                   resolution (zres) is the minimum value the wave function
                   should reach such that a node (zero) is counted. (default:
                   1e-6)
band_char_orbital_threshold
                   In the band character algorithm, the maximum value for the
                   probability density (|psi|^2) in an orbital for the
                   probability density to be considered zero. In that case, the
                   orbital content of that orbital is ignored. (default: 5e-3)
band_char_use_minmax
                   In the band character algorithm, whether to use the 'new'
                   node counting method, that counts flips between local
                   extrema. If set to false, use the legacy method. (boolean
                   value; default: true)
band_char_make_real
                   In the band character algorithm, whether to divide the
                   orbital component by the complex phase factor at its maximum,
                   so that the function becomes effectively real, prior to
                   counting the nodes. If set to false, consider both real and
                   imaginary part as is. (boolean value; default: false)
bandindices_adiabatic_debug
                   Whether to write the intermediate result for adiabatic band
                   index initialization to a csv file. This is useful for
                   debugging this algorithm, for example if the charge
                   neutrality point ends up at an incorrect position. (boolean
                   value; default: false)
band_realign_derivatives
                   Determine the strategy for derivative observables after doing
                   band realignment with kdotpy merge. After realigning the
                   bands, any derivatives in the data will still be with respect
                   to the pre-existing band alignment. Possible options:
                     recalculate  Recalculate the derivatives from the realigned
                                  bands (default).
                     invalidate   Invalidate the derivative quantities by
                                  substituting NaN values.
                     keep         Keep the existing derivative values. These may
                                  no longer be valid if the band alignment has
                                  changed. A warning is shown.
batch_float_format Format string for representation of float values being
                   replaced in the command string. This is a standard %-style
                   conversion, with the following addition: If a . (period) is
                   added to the end, for example '%f.', apply the smart decimal
                   option, i.e., strip superfluous zeros at the end, but keep
                   the decimal point if the value is integer. Useful examples
                   are, among others: %s, %f, %f., %.3f, %g. (default: %s)
batch_stderr_extension
                   Extension for the file, that kdotpy batch writes stderr to.
                   (default: txt)
batch_stdout_extension
                   Extension for the file, that kdotpy batch writes stdout to.
                   (default: txt)
berry_dk           Momentum step size (in nm^-1) for calculating the derivative
                   of the Hamiltonian in the calculation of the Berry curvature
                   as function of momentum. It does not apply to the Berry
                   curvature calculation in Landau-level mode. The value must be
                   positive. (default: 1e-3)
berry_ll_simulate  Whether to use simulated Berry curvature (more accurately:
                   Chern numbers) for Berry / Hall output, for kdotpy ll,
                   instead of the calculated one. The calculated value may
                   sometimes show artifacts that cannot be easily resolved by
                   increasing number of eigenstates for example. The simulated
                   Berry curvature (observable 'berrysim') is set to exactly 1
                   for all states at nonzero magnetic field. (boolean value;
                   default: false)
                   Hint: One may do a comparison by doing the calculation twice
                   with settings 'true' and 'false', respectively. The output is
                   written to different file names as to ease the comparison.
bhz_allow_intermediate_bands
                   Whether to allow a non-contiguous set of A bands. By default
                   (false), do not allow B bands in between the A bands. If set
                   to true, relax this restriction. This only takes effect if
                   the input are band labels, e.g., "bhz E1 H1 L1". It does not
                   apply to numeric input (e.g., "bhz 2 2"), which is a
                   contiguous set by definition. NOTE: Setting True is
                   experimental, it may cause unexpected errors. (boolean value;
                   default: false)
bhz_points         Number of horizontal data points for the BHZ dispersion plot.
                   (default: 200)
bhz_gfactor        Whether to output dimensionless g factors in the BHZ output
                   (tex file). If set to false (default), output dimensionful
                   quantities 'G' in meV / T. (boolean value; default: false)
bhz_abcdm          Whether to output (tex file) a four-band BHZ model in
                   'standard form', using coefficients A, B, C, D, M. If this
                   cannot be done, use the generic form instead. (boolean value;
                   default: false)
bhz_ktilde         If BHZ is done at a nonzero momentum value k0, whether to
                   express the Hamiltonian in the TeX output as shifted momentum
                   tilde{k} = k - k0. If set to false, express it in terms of
                   unshifted momentum k. This option has no effect for BHZ done
                   at k0 = 0. (boolean value; default: true)
bhz_plotcolor      Colour of the BHZ dispersion in the BHZ output file. It may
                   be a single matplotlib colour, a pair separated by a comma
                   (separate colours for each block), or a triplet separated by
                   commas (one block, other block, states without specific
                   block). (default: red,blue,black, legacy value: red)
bhz_plotstyle      Style of the BHZ dispersion in the BHZ output file. It may
                   be a single matplotlib line style, a pair separated by a
                   comma (separate styles for each block), or a triplet
                   separated by commas (one block, other block, states without
                   specific block). Examples are 'solid', 'dashed', 'dotted'.
                   (default: dotted, legacy value: dashed,dotted,solid)
cnp_legacy_method  Whether to use the legacy algorithm for finding the charge
                   neutrality point, that was the default for versions < 0.89.
                   If false (default for versions ≥ 0.89), use the updated
                   algorithm. (boolean value; default: false)
color_bindex       Colormap for band index. For band index only, the range of
                   the observable is adjusted to the number of colours in the
                   colormap. (default: tab21posneg; note: for the 'old' set of
                   colours, use 'tab20alt')
color_dos          Colormap for density of states (default: Blues)
color_energy       Colormap for energy plot (2D dispersion) (default: jet)
color_idos         Colormap for integrated density of states (default: RdBu_r)
color_indexed      Colormap for indexed (discrete) observables
                   (default: tab20alt,tab20)
color_indexedpm    Colormap for indexed (discrete) observables using a 'dual'
                   colour scale, such as 'llindex.sz' (default: tab20)
color_ipr          Colormap for IPR observables (default: inferno_r)
color_localdos     Colormap for local density of states (default: cividis,jet)
color_posobs       Colormap for observables with positive values
                   (default: grayred)
color_potential_yz Colormap for two-dimensional potential plots V(y, z).
                   (default: viridis)
color_shadedpm     Colormap for continuous positive observables using a 'dual'
                   colour scale, such as 'y2.isopz' (default: bluereddual)
color_sigma        Colormap for 'sigma observables' (standard deviation)
                   (default: inferno_r)

color_wf_zy        Colormap for wavefunction plot |psi(z, y)|^2 (default: Blues)
csv_style          Formatting for csv output. Possible values:
                     csvpandas    Comma separated values using pandas module
                     csvinternal  Comma separated values using internal function
                     csv          Choose 'csvpandas' if pandas is available,
                                  otherwise choose 'csvinternal' (default)
                     align        Align values in columns in the text file
csv_multi_index    Determines how a multi-index (LL index, band index) is
                   formatted in csv output. Possible values:
                     tuple        As a tuple (##, ##)  (default)
                     llindex      Only the LL index
                     bindex       Only the band index
                     split        LL index on first row, band index on second
                                  row (alias: tworow)
                     short        Short version of tuple ##,## (space and
                                  parentheses are omitted)
csv_bandlabel_position
                   Location of the band labels in the 'by-band' CSV output.
                   Possible values:
                     top      At the very top, above the other column headings.
                              (default; alias: above)
                     second   Between the data and the other column headings.
                              (alias: between)
                     bottom   At the bottom, below the data. (alias: below)
densityyz_save_binary
                   Whether to save a binary file (Numpy npz format) for the
                   density as function of (y, z), and energy. This quantity is a
                   three-dimensional array, which is also stored as a csv file,
                   but due to its large size may be inefficient to parse. The
                   binary file can be practical for further analysis, such as
                   making sections of the data at multiple energies. Another
                   advantage is that the binary file stores data without loss of
                   precision, unlike the corresponding csv file. (boolean value;
                   default: false)
dos_interpolation_points
                   The minimal number of points on the horizontal axis for some
                   DOS and Berry curvature (Hall conductivity) plots. When the
                   calculated number of (k or b) points is smaller, then perform
                   interpolation to at least this number. Must be an integer; if
                   equal to 0, do not interpolate. (default: 100)
dos_energy_points  The minimal number of points on the energy axis for some DOS
                   and Berry curvature (Hall conductivity) plots. An energy
                   resolution will be chosen so that the energy interval spans
                   at least this many values. (default: 1000)
dos_convolution_points
                   The minimal number of points in the energy variable taken
                   when applying a broadening function (a convolution operation)
                   to an integrated DOS. If the energy range contains fewer
                   points than this value, the integrated DOS is interpolated.
                   Note that this value affects the 'dummy variable' of the
                   convolution integral only, i.e., the internal accuracy of the
                   (numerical) integration. The broadened integrated DOS (the
                   result) will always be with respect to the same energies as
                   the input. (default: 200)
dos_intobs_volume_elements
                   Whether to include the volume elements in the density data
                   representing integrated observables. If true, then the volume
                   element dk is included in the result, so that an integration
                   over momentum k can be done just by summation. If false, the
                   result is a true density, which is not multiplied by dk.
                   (boolean value; default: false)
dos_local_use_byband
                   Whether to calculate the local density of states (local DOS)
                   from the band dispersions. If true (recommended), the local
                   DOS is calculated in the same way as the ordinary DOS, i.e.,
                   using linear interpolation between the data points. If set to
                   false, the calculation is done with the separate data points
                   for 1D dispersions (legacy method). (boolean value; default:
                   true)
dos_local_save_binary
                   Whether to save Numpy binary (npz) files for the local
                   density data. These files can be useful for further analysis
                   of local density data, especially for higher-dimensional
                   grids. (boolean value; default: false)
dos_local_density_at_energy_points
                   If set to a positive value, output the local density at
                   constant energies equally spaced among the energy range
                   (command line argument 'erange'). The number of results in
                   the output is one larger, e.g., setting this value to 10 for
                   energy range -10 to 10 yields output at energies -10, -8,
                   ..., 8, 10 meV. If set to 0, do not output local density at
                   constant energy. (default: 0)
dos_print_validity_range
                   Print the lower and upper bound of the validity range for DOS
                   and IDOS. If the lower bound (first value) is larger than the
                   upper bound (second value), then the DOS and IDOS are invalid
                   for all energies. See also 'plot_dos_validity_range'.
                   (boolean value; default: true)
dos_print_momentum_multiplier
                   The momentum range can be extended by using a multiplier that
                   takes into account the part of momentum space not explicitly
                   calculated. Examples: If only positive momenta are
                   calculated, simulate the negative values by multiplying by 2;
                   or, if in polar coordinates the calculation was done from 0
                   to 90 degrees angle, multiply by 4 for a full circle. This
                   setting determines whether this multiplicative factor should
                   be printed to the standard output. (boolean value; default:
                   false)
dos_quantity       The quantity in which to express density of states. Prior to
                   version v0.95, this was done using the command line arguments
                   densitypnm, densityecm, etc.
                   Possible values:
                     k    Occupied volume in momentum space; units 1/nm^d
                          (alias: momentum)
                     p    Density of particles/carriers (n or dn/dE); units
                          1/nm^d (default; alias: n, particles, carriers,
                          cardens)
                     s    Density of states (IDOS or DOS); units 1/nm^d. The
                          only difference with 'p' is the way the quantities are
                          labelled. (alias: dos, states)
                     e    Density of charge (sigma or dsigma/dE); units e/nm^d
                          (alias: charge)
                   (The exponent d in the unit is adjusted according to the
                   dimensionality.)
dos_unit           The length units used for density of states. Prior to version
                   v0.95, this was done using the command line arguments
                   densitypnm, densityecm, etc.
                   Possible values:
                     nm   Units of 1/nm^d, e/nm^d (default)
                     cm   Units of 1/cm^d, e/cm^d
                     m    Units of 1/m^d, e/m^d
                   In the output, the density values are also scaled to a
                   suitable 'power of ten'. The exponent d in the unit is
                   adjusted according to the dimensionality.
dos_strategy_no_e0 The strategy to follow when trying to extract DOS or IDOS
                   from the band structure, when the zero energy E0 is not well
                   defined. Possible values:
                     strict   Neither DOS nor IDOS can be extracted.
                     dos      DOS can be extracted, but IDOS cannot (default).
                     ignore   Both DOS and IDOS can be extracted, ignoring the
                              fact that E0 may lie at an arbitrary energy value.
                   When E0 is defined (either manually or automatically), the
                   extraction of DOS and IDOS is always possible, regardless of
                   this setting.
fig_matplotlib_style
                   Matplotlib style file for changing the properties of plot
                   elements. This may be a file in the configuration directory
                   (~/.kdotpy) or in the working directory, or a built-in
                   matplotlib style. (default: kdotpy.mplstyle)
fig_hsize, fig_vsize
                   Horizontal and vertical size of the figures, in mm. (default:
                   150, 100, respectively)
fig_lmargin, fig_rmargin, fig_bmargin, fig_tmargin
                   Figure margins (left, right, bottom, top), i.e., the space in
                   mm between the figure edge and the plot area. (default: 20,
                   4, 12, 3, respectively)
fig_charlabel_space
                   Vertical space for the character labels in the dispersion
                   plot, in units of the font size. To avoid overlapping labels,
                   use a value of approximately 0.8 or larger. (default: 0.8)
fig_colorbar_space Space reserved for the colour bar legend in mm (default: 30)
                   In other words, this is the distance between the right-hand
                   edges of the figure and the plot if a colour bar is present.
                   It 'replaces' the right margin.
fig_colorbar_margin
                   Space between the right-hand edge of the plot and the colour
                   bar legend, in mm. This space is taken from the colour bar
                   space (set by fig_colorbar_width), so it does not affect the
                   right-hand edge of the plot. (default: 7.5)
fig_colorbar_size  Width of the actual colour bar in mm (default: 4)
fig_colorbar_method
                   Way to place the colour bar; one of the following options:
                     insert   Take space inside the existing plot; keep the
                              figure size, but decrease the plot size. (default)
                     extend   Add extra space; keep the plot size but increase
                              the figure size.
                     file     Save into a separate file. The original figure is
                              not changed.
fig_colorbar_labelpos
                   Method to determine the position of the label of the colour
                   bar. One of the following options:
                     legacy   The 'old' method, using colorbar.set_label plus a
                              manual shift.
                     xaxis    As label for the 'x axis', directly below the
                              the colour bar.
                     yaxis    As label for the 'y axis', vertically up on the
                              right-hand side.
                     center   Centered in the whole space allocated for the
                              colour bar, including margins; very similar to
                              'legacy' for default settings of the colour bar
                              size and margins. (default)
                     left     Left aligned with the left border of the colour
                              bar.
fig_colorbar_abstwosided
                   Whether a shaded dual colour bar, where the vertical value is
                   the absolute value of the observable, should show the
                   observable itself, with values running from -max to max (if
                   set to true; default). Otherwise show the absolute value,
                   running from 0 to max. (boolean value; default: true)
fig_extend_xaxis   Relative extension of the horizontal plot range for
                   dispersion and magnetic field dependence. For example, a
                   value of '0.05' means 5% of the range is added left and right
                   of the minimum and maximum x value (where x is k or B),
                   respectively. This does not affect the range if the command
                   line argument 'xrange' is used. Use '0' to not extend the
                   plot range. The value may not be negative. (default: 0.05)
fig_inset_size     Size (width and height) of the inset legend in mm. Values
                   smaller than 30 are not recommended. (default: 30)
fig_inset_margin   Space between inset edge and plot edge in mm. (default: 3)
fig_inset_color_resolution
                   Number of colour gradations along each axis for the RGB
                   (inset) legend. Do not change unless file size is an issue.
                   (default: 20)
fig_legend_fontsize
                   Specify the font size of the legend. May also be set to
                   'auto' for automatic; this yields a font size of 8 for RGB
                   (inset) legend, 10 for other legend or colorbars (may be
                   subject to settings in matplotlibrc and/or style files).
                   (default: auto)
fig_spin_arrow_length
                   Arrow length in spin plots. The value is the length in mm for
                   arrows representing spin value 0.5 or a direction.
                   (default: 5)
fig_max_arrows     Maximum number of arrows in a vector plot in each dimension.
                   The value 0 means no limit. (default: 20)
fig_arrow_color_2d Color of the arrows in a 2D vector plot. This must be a
                   valid matplotlib colour. (default: #c0c0c0)
fig_ticks_major    Strategy to determine the major ticks in the plots. Possible
                   choices:
                     none    No major ticks
                     auto    Determine number of ticks automatically (based on
                             plot size). (default)
                     fewer   A few ticks per axis (typically 3)
                     normal  A moderate amount of ticks per axis (typically 6)
                     more    Many ticks per axis (typically 12)
                   One can use different choices for the horizontal and vertical
                   axis, as follows: 'fig_ticks_major=normal,fewer'
fig_ticks_minor    Strategy to determine the minor ticks in the plots. Possible
                   choices:
                     none    No minor ticks (default)
                     auto    Determine automatically (matplotlib's algorithm)
                     fewer   Few minor ticks (major interval divided by 2)
                     normal  Moderately many ticks (major interval divided by 4
                             or 5).
                     more    Many minor ticks (major interval divided by 10)
                   One can use different choices for the horizontal and vertical
                   axis, as follows: 'fig_ticks_minor=fewer,none'
fig_unit_format    Opening and closing bracket of the units in axis and legend
                   labels. (default: [])
lattice_regularization
                   Enables or disables lattice regularization. The settings
                   'true' and 'false' correspond to the obsolete command-line
                   arguments 'latticereg' and 'nolatticereg', respectively. The
                   recommended value and default value is 'false'. Note that
                   for older kdotpy versions (kdotpy v0.xx), the default value
                   was 'true' for compatibility reasons.
                   (boolean value; default: false)
lattice_zres_strict
                   Enables or disable strict check of commensurability of z
                   resolution with thickness of the layers, i.e., whether the
                   thicknesses are integer multiples of the z resolution. If
                   they are incommensurate, quit with an error if strict
                   checking is enabled. If disabled, change the thicknesses to
                   match the z resolution and raise a warning. (boolean value;
                   default: true)
lattice_ycoord_midpoints
                   Determines how the y coordinate values are aligned. If set to
                   'false' (default), the first and last coordinate value are at
                   -w / 2 and w / 2, where w is the width. This method is
                   analogous to the assignment of the z coordinates. If set to
                   'true', use the legacy method where the coordinate values are
                   shifted by half the y resolution yres. The number of
                   coordinate values is w / yres + 1 or w / yres for 'false' and
                   'true', respectively. This setting is ignored for data
                   imported from XML files, e.g., read by 'kdotpy merge' or if
                   the number of coordinate values is given explicitly with the
                   command line argument 'w'. (boolean value; default: false)
magn_epsilon       Numeric value that determines whether small values near zero
                   need to be inserted if the grid contains magnetic fields. The
                   value zero means disabling this feature. Otherwise, +/- the
                   absolute value of magn_epsilon is inserted at either side of
                   B = 0, whichever side (positive or negative) is included in
                   the range. If negative, insert the values only if the range
                   is two-sided. The motivation for including this option is to
                   reduce some plot artifacts for ranges that contain positive
                   and negative magnetic fields. For this option to be
                   effective, it might also be necessary to set the 'split'
                   parameter to a small value. (default: -1e-4)
selfcon_acceptable_status
                   Maximum status level for the result of the self-consistent
                   Hartree calculation to be considered valid. Possible values:
                     0   Successful
                     1   Calculation skipped or aborted (default)
                     2   Did not converge, but convergence is likely after more
                         iterations
                     3   Did not converge, convergence cannot be estimated or is
                         unlikely
                     4   Failed
selfcon_check_chaos_steps
                   Number of previous iterations used for the detection of
                   chaotic behaviour. If this value is set to n, we say chaos
                   occurs at iteration i if the previous V_j closest to V_i are
                   more than n iterations ago, i.e., i - j > n. When chaos is
                   detected, adjust the time step if selfcon_dynamic_time_step
                   is set to true. (default: 4)
selfcon_check_orbit_steps
                   Number of previous iterations used for the detection of
                   periodic orbits. We say a periodic orbit occurs at iteration
                   i if the previous V_j closest to V_i show a regular pattern
                   like j - i = 2, 4, 6, 8; the value n set here is the minimum
                   length of the regular pattern. When a periodic orbit is
                   detected, adjust the time step if selfcon_dynamic_time_step
                   is set to true. (default: 4)
selfcon_convergent_steps
                   Number of consecutive convergent steps (iteration steps where
                   the convergence condition is met) required for the self-
                   consistent Hartree calculation to be considered successful.
                   This prevents accidental convergence which could lead to a
                   spurious solution. (default: 5)
selfcon_debug      Whether to enable debug mode for the self-consistent Hartree
                   calculation. In debug mode, write temporary files and provide
                   traceback for all exceptions (also KeyboardInterrupt) within
                   the iteration loop, which is useful for debugging. If debug
                   mode is disabled, then do not write temporary files and
                   continue on SelfConError and KeyboardInterrupt exceptions.
                   (boolean value; default: false)
selfcon_diff_norm  Method that defines a measure of convergence for the self-
                   consistent calculation. This method is essentially a function
                   applied to the difference of potentials of the last two
                   iteration steps. The result, a nonnegative value, is compared
                   to the convergence criterion. Possible values:
                     max   The maximum of the difference. Also known as supremum
                           norm or L-infinity norm.
                     rms   The root-mean-square of the difference. This is the
                           L2 norm. (default)
selfcon_dynamic_time_step
                   Whether the "time" step for the self-consistent calculation
                   is adapted automatically between iterations. If set to false,
                   the time step stays the same between iterations (boolean
                   value; default: false).
selfcon_erange_from_eivals
                   Whether to use the eigenvalues from first diagonalization
                   result to determine the energy range used for calculating the
                   density of states for the self-consistent calculation. If
                   false, the energy range given in the command line is used
                   instead. (boolean value; default: false).
selfcon_full_diag  Whether to use the full-diagonalization approach for the
                   self-consistent Hartree calculation. If true, use the full-
                   diagonalization approach that calculates all conduction band
                   states to determine density as function of z. If false, use
                   the standard mode that calculates bands around the CNP. The
                   latter is significantly faster, but the results are based on
                   an implausible assumption on the density at the CNP. (boolean
                   value; default: true)
selfcon_ll_use_broadening
                   Whether to enable broadening during self-consistent
                   calculation in LL mode.
                   This can lead to bad convergence behaviour (or no convergence
                   at all, depending on selected broadening), but results in
                   more accurate Hartree potentials for the given broadening.
                   This does not affect the broadening applied to the main
                   diagonalization/postprocessing after the self-consistent
                   calculation has finished. (boolean value; default: false)
selfcon_energy_points
                   The minimal number of points on the energy axis for the self-
                   consistent calculation. An energy resolution will be chosen
                   so that the energy interval spans at least this many values.
                   This number may be fairly high without performance penalty.
                   (default: 1000)
selfcon_min_time_step
                   The minimal value for the "time" step for the self-consistent
                   calculation. If selfcon_dynamic_time_step is set to true,
                   the time step can never get lower than this value. Allowed
                   values are between 0 and 1. (default: 0.001)
selfcon_potential_average_zero
                   Shift the potential such that its average will be zero at
                   each iteration of the self-consistent calculation. Enabling
                   this option is recommended for reasons of stability and for
                   consistency of the output. (boolean value; default: true)
selfcon_symmetrization_constraint
                   Constraint on how the symmetry is checked and symmetrization
                   performed on multiple quantities when solving the Poisson
                   equation. When symmetry norm is below threshold the quantity
                   is always fully symmetrized over whole layer stack (except
                   for 'never'). Possible values:
                     never   Symmetry will not be checked. No symmetrization is
                             performed.
                     strict  Symmetry is checked over whole layer stack.
                             (default)
                     loose   Symmetry is checked over the well region only. This
                             method is preferred for asymmetric layer stacks.
selfcon_use_init_density
                   Determine the initial density profile applied to the first
                   iteration of the self-consistent Hartree calculation. If an
                   initial potential is loaded from a file using the
                   'potential' argument, the loaded potential takes precedence.
                     false       Use the Hamiltonian with zero potential
                                 (default).
                     true        Uniformly distribute the total carrier density
                                 from the 'cardens' argument across the well
                                 region and solve for the Hartree potential.
                     background  Place free charge carriers to exactly cancel
                                 the background/depletion charges. Uniformly
                                 distribute the remaining free carriers from
                                 'cardens' over the well region.
transitions_min_amplitude
                   Minimum amplitude to consider for transitions. The lower this
                   number, the larger the number of data points and the larger
                   the data files and plots. (default: 0.01)
transitions_min_deltae
                   Minimum energy difference in meV to consider for transitions.
                   This value is proportional to a minimal frequency. The
                   smaller this number, the larger the number of data points and
                   the larger the data files and plots. (default: 0.1)
transitions_max_deltae
                   Maximum energy difference in meV of transitions, i.e., upper
                   limit of the vertical axis (filtered transitions plot only).
                   If set to 0, determine the vertical scale automatically.
                   (default: 0)
transitions_dispersion_num
                   Number of transitions to include in the dispersion or B
                   dependence (LL fan) plot. If set to n, the transitions with
                   n highest transitions rates will be shown.  If set to 0, show
                   an unlimited number of transitions. (default: 4)
transitions_broadening_type
                   Shape of the broadening function used for broadening the
                   transitions in the absorption plot. Possible choices:
                     step        A step function (alias: delta)
                     lorentzian  Lorentzian function (Cauchy distribution),
                                 scale parameter gamma, which is the half-width
                                 at half-maximum. (default; alias: lorentz)
                     gaussian    Gaussian function, scale parameter sigma, which
                                 is the standard deviation. (alias: gauss,
                                 normal)
                     fermi       Fermi function (thermal distribution), scale
                                 parameter is energy. (alias: logistic, sech)
                     thermal     Fermi function (thermal distribution), scale
                                 parameter is temperature.
                   NOTE: Change in versions >= 0.79. The types 'fermi' and
                   'thermal' are no longer aliases. They have the same shape,
                   but the scale ('width') parameter is treated differently, as
                   energy and temperature, respectively.
                   The broadening functions for the absorption are the
                   probability density functions for all of these choices.
transitions_broadening_scale
                   Scale parameter of the broadening function. This may be an
                   energy (in meV) or a temperature (in K) that determines the
                   amount of broadening (i.e., its 'width'). (default: 2.5)
transitions_all_if_filtered
                   Output plot and table of all transitions if a carrier density
                   is set. If false, suppress output of all transitions if
                   filtered transitions are being requested. (boolean value;
                   default: false)
transitions_spectra
                   (experimental)
                   Output spectral plots and tables if a carrier density is set.
                   If false, skip (time consuming) spectra calculation.
                   (boolean value; default: false)
transitions_plot   Output transition plot. If false, do not create and save a
                   a transitions plot. (boolean value; default: true)
plot_enable        Enable or disable the construction and output of all plots.
                   Set this option to 'false' if plot files (PDF) are not
                   desired. (boolean value; default: true)
plot_constdens_color
                   The colour of the curves in the 'constdens' plots. The value
                   must be a valid matplotlib colour. (default: blue)
plot_dispersion_default_color
                   The uniform colour of the dispersion curves, if there is no
                   colour scale set for the given observable (or if no
                   observable is set). The value must be a valid matplotlib
                   colour. (default: blue)
plot_dispersion_energies
                   Plot special energies, e.g., charge-neutrality point, Fermi
                   energy/chemical potential at zero and finite density in
                   dispersion plots. (boolean value; default: true)
plot_dispersion_energies_color
                   The line colour for special energies. The value must be a
                   valid matplotlib colour. If left empty, take lines.color from
                   matplotlibrc or a style file. (default: black)
plot_dispersion_parameter_text
                   Write an indication in the plot for constant parameter
                   values, e.g., when plotting along kx for a nonzero ky value,
                   write "For k_y = <value>". (boolean value; default: true)
plot_dispersion_stack_by_index
                   If enabled, make sure the data with the lowest band or
                   Landau-level index is shown on top, to make sure the 'most
                   interesting data' (low-index states) is not obscured by 'less
                   interesting data' (high-index states). Otherwise, the plot
                   function uses the default plot stacking order: the data is
                   then drawn simply in the order by which it is processed.
                   (boolean value; default: false)
plot_dos_color     Colour of the curves in the (integrated) density of states
                   (IDOS/DOS) plots. The value must be a valid matplotlib
                   colour. (default: blue)
plot_dos_energies  Plot special energies, e.g., charge-neutrality point, Fermi
                   energy/chemical potential at zero and finite density in
                   density (DOS) plots. (boolean value; default: true)
plot_dos_fill      Fill the area between the curve and zero in the DOS plot (not
                   integrated DOS). (boolean value; default: false)
plot_idos_fill     Fill the area between the curve and zero in the integrated
                   DOS plot. (boolean value; default: false)
plot_dos_units_negexp
                   Use negative exponents in DOS units in density plots. If set
                   to true, write "nm^-2" instead of "1/nm^2", for example.
                   (boolean value; default: false)
plot_dos_validity_range
                   Shade the area in the (integrated) DOS plot where the value
                   is expected to be incorrect due to missing data (due to
                   momentum cutoff). (boolean value; default: true)
plot_dos_vertical  Plot the (integrated) DOS sideways, so that energy is plotted
                   on the vertical axis. The vertical scale will match the
                   dispersion plot, so that these figures can be put
                   side-by-side with a common axis. (boolean value; default:
                   true)
plot_ecnp          Plot the charge neutral energy as function of k or B. This is
                   the boundary between "electron" and "hole" states (positive
                   and negative band indices, respectively). (boolean value;
                   default: false)
plot_potential_yz_contours
                   Whether to include equipotential contours in plots of the
                   two-dimensional potential V(y, z). (boolean value; default:
                   true)
plot_potential_yz_equal_aspect
                   Whether to respect the geometric aspect ratio in plots of the
                   two-dimensional potential V(y, z). If set to true, the plot
                   area may be shrunk horizontally or vertically, such that 1 nm
                   in either direction is represented by the same distance. If
                   set to false, the axes are scaled independently to fill the
                   full plot area. (boolean value; default: false)
plot_rasterize_pcolormesh
                   Whether to rasterize plot elements created with pcolormesh
                   from matplotlib. This is used primarily for two-dimensional
                   color plots with kdotpy ll when one uses quadratic stepping
                   for the magnetic field values. Rasterization leads to
                   improved performance both in creating the plots as well as in
                   rendering them with a pdf viewer. The resolution can be
                   controlled with the matplotlibrc parameters 'figure.dpi' and
                   'savefig.dpi'. If the old behaviour is desired, i.e., that
                   the data is rendered as vector graphics, set the value of
                   plot_rasterize_pcolormesh to 'false'. (boolean value;
                   default: true)
plot_rxy_hall_slope
                   Plot the Hall slope R_xy = B / (n e), where B is magnetic
                   field, n is density and e is electron charge, in the plots
                   for R_xy (rxy-constdens.pdf) as a dashed line. (boolean
                   value; default: true)
plot_sdh_markers   Whether to show markers for the period of the SdH
                   oscillations in the 'constdens' plot (both 'normal' and 'SdH'
                   versions). The markers are placed at the values for which
                   1 / B is a multiple of e / (2 pi hbar n), where n is the
                   density. (boolean value; default: true)
plot_sdh_markers_color
                   Colour of the SdH markers in the 'constdens' plots. The value
                   must be a valid matplotlib colour. (default: red)
plot_sdh_scale_amount
                   The maximum number of SdH oscillations to be shown in the SdH
                   plot. If set to a nonzero value, the scale on the horizontal
                   axis is magnified to this amount of SdH oscillations. The
                   scale is never shrunk, so there may be fewer SdH oscillations
                   on the axis. The 'constdens' plot linear in B is unaffected.
                   If set to 0 (default), do not scale the axis. A typical
                   useful nonzero value is 20.
plot_transitions_labels
                   Show some labels in transitions plot. (boolean value;
                   default: true)

plot_wf_orbitals_realshift
                   Phase-shift the orbital functions to purely real values
                   before plotting. This results in a single line plot per
                   orbital with consistent amplitudes and signs. The actual
                   phases are still given at the right side of the figure. Uses
                   straight/dashed lines for +/- angular momentum orbitals.
                   (default: false)
plot_wf_orbitals_order

                   data. Possible choices: none (alias: false), raw, plain,
                   unicode, tex (see table_dispersion_unit_style below). If

                   output. Possible choices: none (alias: false), raw, plain,
                   unicode, tex (see table_dispersion_unit_style below). If
                   none, do not write a unit. Also, if 'table_data_label_style'

                               without compression.
                   For the archive options (tar, zip, etc.), delete the csv
                   files if the archive has been written successfully; otherwise
                   keep the csv files. Some options may be unavailable depending
                   on the installed Python modules.
table_dos_precision
                   Precision (number of decimals) for floating point numbers,

                   true, write "nm^-2" instead of "1/nm^2", for example.
                   (boolean value; default: false)
table_densityyz_scaling
                   Whether to scale the density units for density as function of
                   (y, z) and energy. If set to false, the values are always
                   given in units of nm^-3 (or equivalently, 10^21 cm^-3 or
                   10^27 m^-3). If set to true, the values are scaled to a
                   suitable 'power of ten'. See also configuration 'dos_unit'.
                   (boolean value; default: false)                   
table_dispersion_precision
                   Precision (number of decimals) for floating point numbers,
                   for the dispersion csv files. Energy and momentum values may
                   use a different number of decimals. (minimum: 2, default: 5)
table_dispersion_data_label
                   Whether to include the observable at the end of the first
                   data row in a multi-dimensional dispersion csv table (e.g.,
                   with two or three momentum variables). (boolean value;
                   default: true)
table_dispersion_units
                   Whether to include units of the variables and observables in
                   dispersion csv files. For a one-dimensional dispersion, these
                   are included as second header row. For a multi-dimensional
                   dispersion, the unit is added at the end of the first data
                   row. (boolean value; default: true)
table_dispersion_unit_style
                   Style for expressing units. Possible choices:
                     raw       'Without' formatting
                     plain     Plain-text formatting using common symbols (e.g.,
                               square is ^2 and Greek letters are spelled out)
                     unicode   Formatting using 'fancy' Unicode symbols (e.g.,
                               square is the superscript-2 symbol and Greek
                               letters use their corresponding Unicode symbol).
                     tex       LaTeX formatting
                   (default: plain)
                   NOTE: Even with 'raw' or 'plain', there may still be some
                   non-ASCII symbols, for example µ.
table_dispersion_obs_style
                   Style for expressing observables/quantities. Possible
                   choices: raw, plain, unicode, tex (see above). (default: raw)
table_qz_precision Precision (number of decimals) for floating point numbers,
                   for the 'Q(z)' (z-dependent quantity) csv files. (default: 5)
table_extrema_precision
                   Precision (number of decimals) for floating point numbers,
                   for the extrema csv files. (default: 5)
table_absorption_precision
                   Precision (number of decimals) for floating point numbers,
                   for the absorption csv files (associated with transitions).
                   (default: 5)
table_transitions_deltall
                   Whether to include a column labelled 'deltaLL' that indicates
                   the difference between the Landau level indices, i.e., the
                   polarity of each transition. As of kdotpy version 1.3, the
                   columns 'LL1' and 'LL2' are left blank because the LL indices
                   themselves are not meaningful. Enabling this option gives
                   access to the polarity even if the LL indices are
                   ill-defined. This option applies to symbolic and full LL mode
                   equally. (boolean value; default: false)
table_transitions_precision
                   Precision (number of decimals) for floating point numbers,
                   for the transitions csv files. (default: 3)
table_transitions_ratecoeff_unit
                   Unit for the rate coefficient for optical transitions.
                   (default: nm^2/mV/ns)
table_bdependence_filter_erange
                   Apply the energy range filter specified by the erange
                   argument to the csv output for B dependence. (boolean value;
                   default: false)
table_dispersion_filter_erange
                   Apply the energy range filter specified by the erange
                   argument to the csv output for dispersions. (boolean value;
                   default: false)
table_wf_files     Which type of files should be written for the wave function
                   data. Possible choices:
                     none      No files are written.
                     csv       Write csv files only. (default)
                     tar       Write csv files, pack them into a tar file.
                     targz     Write csv files, pack them into a gzipped tar
                               file (compression level 6). (alias: gz, gzip,
                               tar.gz)
                     zip       Write csv files, pack them into a zip file with
                               'deflate' compression.
                     zipnozip  Write csv files, pack them into a zip file
                               without compression.
                   For the archive options (tar, zip, etc.), delete the csv
                   files if the archive has been written successfully; otherwise
                   keep the csv files. Some options may be unavailable depending
                   on the installed Python modules.
table_wf_precision Precision (number of decimals) for floating point numbers,
                   for the wave function csv files. (default: 5)
wf_locations_exact_match
                   If set to true (default), the wave function locations should
                   match the momentum/magnetic field values exactly. If no exact
                   match is found, skip the location ('old behaviour'). If set
                   to false, find the nearest value to each location. (boolean
                   value; default: true)
wf_locations_filename
                   Whether to label the wave function files using the position
                   (momentum/magnetic field). If set to false, label with
                   numbers. (boolean value; default: true)
xml_omit_default_config_values
                   If set to true, do not save all configuration values to the
                   XML output file, but only the ones that are set to a value
                   different than the default value. Otherwise save all values
                   (default); this is recommended for reproducibility.
                   (boolean value; default: false)
xml_shorten_command
                   If set to true, replace the script path in the <cmdargs> tag
                   by 'kdotpy xx' (where xx = 1d, 2d, etc.) if typing 'kdotpy'
                   on the command line refers to the kdotpy main script. For
                   this, the main script (or a link to it) must be in the PATH
                   environment variable; this is generally the case if kdotpy
                   has been installed with pip. (boolean value; default: false)


NOTE: Valid colormaps are all matplotlib colormaps (see, e.g.,
https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html), plus the following ones
defined by kdotpy itself:
bluered      Designed for symmetric observables; blue gray red.
grayred      Designed for positive observables; gray red, like the top half of
             colormap 'bluered'
yrbc         Designed for observables with range -3/2 to 3/2, an extension of
             colormap 'bluered';
             cyan (-3/2) blue (-1/2) gray (0) red (1/2) yellow (3/2)
yrbc2        Slightly modified version of colormap 'yrbc'
tab20alt     The set of colours from the matplotlib colormap 'tab20' but in a
             different order. This can be used with 'indexed' colours in order
             to match the 'indexedpm' colours if set to 'tab20'.
tab21posneg  Another set of colours derived from the matplotlib colormap
             'tab20', such that the values +n and -n correspond to brighter and
             darker shades of the same colour. For 0, use black. This colormap
             is especially designed for band indices.
bluereddual  Designed for use as dual colormap; blue to bluish gray, reddish
             gray to red.

NOTE: For colormaps, multiple instances may be given by separating them with
commas. The colormaps are tried in order. If the first one is not a valid
colormap, then try the second, etc. This construct is to provide colormaps that
do not exist in all versions of matplotlib or have changed names.

NOTE: A custom colormap may be used using 'file:colormap.txt' where colormap.txt
is a colormap file. A colormap file should be simple text file, where each line
is either a single matplotlib colour, or a combination of the form
'value:color', where value is a number in the interval [0, 1]. The two forms may
not be mixed in one file.
A list of single colours creates a matplotlib colormap of type ListedColormap;
this is useful for indexed colours, as no interpolation takes place. A list of
'value:color' entries creates a LinearSegmentedColormap. This is a continuous
colour gradient. Discontinuities at can be achieved by listing the value twice,
e.g., '0.5:#ff0000' and '0.5:#0000ff' on two subsequent lines.

NOTE: Boolean configuration options may have the following values (not case
sensitive):
for "True": yes, y, true, t, 1, enabled, on
for "False": no, n, false, f, 0, disabled, off
