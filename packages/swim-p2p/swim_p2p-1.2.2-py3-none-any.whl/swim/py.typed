The py.typed file is intentionally empty. It's just a marker file that tells type checkers (like mypy) and IDEs that your package includes type information.

What this file does:

Signals that your package supports type checking (PEP 561)
Allows other projects to use your package's type hints
Enables better IDE support and static analysis
Required for publishing packages with type information
Why it's empty:

It's just a marker - no content needed
The presence of the file is what matters
Type information comes from your actual .py files with type hints
This small file makes your package much more useful for developers using type checkers!
