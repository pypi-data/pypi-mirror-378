## Installation

### Conda environment

It is highly recommended to create a dedicated conda environment, by following these few steps:

1. Install an [Anaconda] distribution of Python. Note you might need to use an anaconda prompt if you did not add anaconda to the path.

2. Open an Anaconda prompt as admin to create a new environment using [conda]. We advice to use python 3.10 and conda 23.10.0, to get conda-libmamba-solver as default solver.

```
conda create --name cell_cycle_classification python=3.10 conda=23.10.0
conda activate cell_cycle_classification
```

### Package installation

Once in a dedicated environment, our package can be installed via [pip]:

```
pip install cell_cycle_classification
```

Alternatively, you can clone the github repo to access to notebooks.

```
git clone https://github.com/15bonte/cell_cycle_classification.git
cd cell_cycle_classification
pip install -e .
```

### GPU

We highly recommend to use GPU to speed up segmentation. To use your NVIDIA GPU, the first step is to download the dedicated driver from [NVIDIA].

Next we need to remove the CPU version of torch:

```bash
pip uninstall torch
```

The GPU version of torch to be installed can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). You may choose the CUDA version supported by your GPU, and install it with conda. This package has been developed with the version 11.6, installed with this command:

```bash
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

## Update

To update cell_cycle_classification to the latest version, open an Anaconda prompt and use the following commands:

```bash
conda activate cell_cycle_classification
pip install cell_cycle_classification --upgrade
```

## Notebooks, models and data

Notebooks are provided as examples to demonstrate how to train and test our model. You can experiment with them using a subset of our data, available from [Zenodo]. Complete dataset is available on the [BioImage Archive].

- Train: this notebook shows the training of both VAE and classification models.
- Eval VAE: this notebook evaluates image reconstruction accuracy and time consistency from our pretrained VAE model, available from [HuggingFace].
- Eval classifier: similarly, this notebook evaluates cell cycle classification accuracy from our pretrained classification model, available from [HuggingFace.]
- Predict cell cycle phase: this notebook predicts the cell cycle phase of a single image file, included in the repository. It uses our pretrained classification model, available from [HuggingFace.]
