# BallisticCalculator

LGPL library for small arms ballistic calculations based on point-mass (3 DoF) plus spin drift.  

This repo offers [`py_ballisticcalc`](https://github.com/o-murphy/py-ballisticcalc) under the more convenient name `pyballistic`.

# Installation

## pip

```shell
pip install pyballistic

# Using precompiled backend (improves performance)
pip install pyballistic[exts]

# Using matplotlib and pandas uses additional dependencies
pip install pyballistic[charts]

# Get everything, including the SciPy-powered calculation engine
pip install pyballistic[exts,charts,scipy]
```

## [Calculation Engines](https://dbookstaber.github.io/pyballistic/latest/concepts/engines)

Choose between different calculation engines, or build your own.  Included engines:

| Engine Name               |   Speed        | Dependencies    | Description                    |
|:--------------------------|:--------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------------------|
| `rk4_engine`              | Baseline (1x)  | None, default   | Runge-Kutta 4th-order integration  |
| `euler_engine`            |  0.5x (slower) | None            | Euler 1st-order integration |
| `verlet_engine`           |  0.7x (slower) | None            | Verlet 2nd-order integration |
| `cythonized_rk4_engine`   | 50x (faster)   | `[exts]`        | Compiled Runge-Kutta 4th-order |
| `cythonized_euler_engine` | 40x (faster)   | `[exts]`        | Compiled Euler integration |
| `scipy_engine`            | 10x (faster)   | `scipy`         | Advanced numerical methods |


## Keeping in sync with upstream

This repository tracks the upstream project [`py-ballisticcalc`](https://github.com/o-murphy/py-ballisticcalc) while preserving a few local differences (package name, URLs, and select docs like this README).

- Sync locally:
  - `python scripts/sync_upstream.py` to sync latest `master` from upstream.
  - `python scripts/sync_upstream.py --ref pull/219/head` to sync a specific PR.
  - Add `--clean` to remove files deleted upstream (excluded paths remain).
- Automation:
  - GitHub Action `Sync Upstream` runs on-demand, opening a PR with changes.  It can also be scheduled to run regularly (uncomment the `schedule` block).
- Configuration:
  - See `sync_config.json` for upstream repo/branch, text/path replacements, and excluded files.  Adjust `exclude_paths` if you want additional files to remain customized here.

## RISK NOTICE

The library performs numerical approximations of complex physical processes.
The calculation results MUST NOT be considered as completely and reliably reflecting real-world behavior of projectiles. While these results may be used for educational purpose, they must NOT be considered as reliable for the areas where incorrect calculation may cause making a wrong decision, financial harm, or can put a human life at risk.
