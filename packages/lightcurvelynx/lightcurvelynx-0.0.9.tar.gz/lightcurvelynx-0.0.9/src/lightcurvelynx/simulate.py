    Parameters
    ----------
    model : BasePhysicalModel
        The model to draw from. This may have its own parameters which
        will be randomly sampled with each draw.
    num_samples : int
        The number of samples.
    obstable : ObsTable or List of ObsTable
        The ObsTable(s) from which to extract information for the samples.
    passbands : PassbandGroup or List of PassbandGroup
        The passbands to use for generating the bandfluxes.
    apply_obs_mask: boolean
        If True, apply obs_mask to filter interesting indices/times.
    time_window_offset : tuple(float, float), optional
        A tuple specifying the time window offset (before, after) t0 in days.
        This is used to filter the observations to only those within the specified
        time window (t0 - before, t0 + after). If None or the model does not have a
        t0 specified, no time window is applied.
    obstable_save_cols : list of str, optional
        A list of ObsTable columns to be saved as part of the results. This is used
        to save context information about how the light curves were generated. If the column
        is missing from one of the ObsTables, a null value such as None or NaN is used.
        If None, no additional columns are saved.
    param_cols : list of str, optional
        A list of the model's parameter columns to be saved as separate columns in
        the results (instead of just the full dictionary of parameters). These
        must be specified as strings in the node_name.param_name format.
        If None, no additional columns are saved.
    rng : numpy.random._generator.Generator, optional
        A given numpy random number generator to use for this computation. If not
        provided, the function uses the node's random number generator.
    generate_citations : bool, optional
        If True, generate citations for the simulation and output them.
