    LSST bandpasses (v1.9), using a standard atmosphere scaled
    for different airmasses and scaled for exposure times.

    Parameters
    ----------
    band : ndarray of str
        The filter for which to return the photometric zeropoint.
    airmass : ndarray of float
        The airmass at which to return the photometric zeropoint.
    exptime : ndarray of float
        The exposure time for which to return the photometric zeropoint.
    instr_zp : dict[str, float] or None
        The instrumental zeropoint for each bandpass,
        i.e. AB-magnitude that produces 1 electron in a 1-second exposure.
        Keys are the bandpass names, values are the zeropoints.
        If None, the LSST zeropoints are used:
        {_lsstcam_zeropoint_per_sec_zenith}
    ext_coeff : dict[str, float]
        Atmospheric extinction coefficient for each bandpass.
        Keys are the bandpass names, values are the coefficients.
        If None, the LSST coefficients are used:
        {_lsstcam_extinction_coeff}

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray of float
        AB mags that produces 1 electron.

    Notes
    -----
    Typically, zeropoints are defined as the magnitude of a source
    which would produce 1 count in a 1 second exposure -
    here we use *electron* counts, not ADU counts.
