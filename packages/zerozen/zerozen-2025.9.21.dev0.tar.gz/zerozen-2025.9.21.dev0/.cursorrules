## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


ZeroZen implements an AI agent system with integrated memory capabilities and Google service connections. The core business logic is organized around:

1. Agent Hub System (Importance: 90)
`src/zerozen/agenthub/main.py`
- Manages specialized agents through a triage system
- Coordinates handoffs between different agent types based on user requests
- Integrates Gmail and Calendar tools into agent workflows

2. Memory Architecture (Importance: 85)
`src/zerozen/memory/api.py`
- Stores and retrieves conversational context using semantic embeddings
- Implements LanceDB-based vector storage for conversation history
- Enables contextual responses through semantic search capabilities

3. Google Service Integration (Importance: 80)
`src/zerozen/integrations/google/google_agent.py`
- Implements privacy-conscious Gmail and Calendar access
- Manages OAuth authentication workflows
- Provides read-only data access with explicit consent requirements

4. Memory Agent Implementation (Importance: 75)
`src/zerozen/agenthub/memagent.py`
- Handles conversation storage and retrieval
- Maintains contextual awareness across interactions
- Implements tool-based memory operations

5. Google Tool Suite (Importance: 70)
`src/zerozen/integrations/google/gmail_tool.py`
`src/zerozen/integrations/google/calendar_tool.py`
- Provides email search and calendar event management
- Implements secure credential handling
- Enables cross-service data integration

The system architecture prioritizes:
- Modular agent specialization
- Secure third-party service integration
- Contextual memory preservation
- Privacy-conscious data access
- Tool-based task execution
