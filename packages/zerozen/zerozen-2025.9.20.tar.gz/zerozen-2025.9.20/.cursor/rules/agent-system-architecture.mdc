# agent-system-architecture

## Core Agent Architecture Components

### 1. Agent Hub Orchestration (Importance: 95)
Path: `src/zerozen/agenthub/main.py`
- Central triage system that routes user requests to specialized agents
- Manages agent handoffs and state transitions between different agent types
- Coordinates tool access and permissions across agent boundaries

### 2. Memory-Augmented Agents (Importance: 90)
Path: `src/zerozen/agenthub/memagent.py`
- Memory agent with semantic search and retrieval capabilities
- Contextual conversation storage with embedding-based recall
- Integration with LanceDB for persistent memory storage

### 3. Google Service Integration (Importance: 85)
Path: `src/zerozen/integrations/google/google_agent.py`
- Specialized agent for Gmail and Calendar operations
- Privacy-first design with read-only access controls
- Structured tool integration patterns for Google APIs

## Agent Communication Patterns

### 1. Tool Integration Framework (Importance: 85)
Paths:
- `src/zerozen/integrations/google/gmail_tool.py`
- `src/zerozen/integrations/google/calendar_tool.py`
- Standardized tool registration and access patterns
- Credential management and OAuth flow integration
- Cross-agent tool sharing mechanisms

### 2. Agent State Management (Importance: 80)
Path: `src/zerozen/agents.py`
- Conversation context preservation between agent handoffs
- Tool state synchronization across agent boundaries
- Memory persistence across agent transitions

## Specialized Agent Types

### 1. Google Integration Agent (Importance: 85)
Path: `src/zerozen/integrations/google/google_agent.py`
- Email and calendar data access patterns
- Privacy-aware interaction model
- Structured response formatting for Google service data

### 2. Memory Agent (Importance: 80)
Path: `src/zerozen/agenthub/memagent.py`
- Conversational context management
- Semantic search integration
- Historical interaction retrieval
