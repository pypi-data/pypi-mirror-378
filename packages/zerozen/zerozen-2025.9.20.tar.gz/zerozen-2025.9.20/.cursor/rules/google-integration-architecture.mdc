# google-integration-architecture

The Google integration architecture implements secure access to Google services with privacy-focused agents and tools.

## Core Components

### OAuth Credential Management (Importance: 90)
`src/zerozen/integrations/google/creds.py`
- Structured credential management system for Google OAuth
- Supports both desktop and backend authentication flows
- Implements secure token storage and automatic refresh
- Maintains per-user isolation of credentials

### Gmail Integration Tools (Importance: 85)
`src/zerozen/integrations/google/gmail_tool.py`
- Read-only access to Gmail data with privacy controls
- Email search and retrieval with content protection
- Requires explicit user consent for email body access
- Implements structured email data extraction

### Calendar Integration Tools (Importance: 85)
`src/zerozen/integrations/google/calendar_tool.py`
- Calendar event listing and search capabilities
- Event detail retrieval with privacy constraints
- Time-based queries for schedule management
- Read-only access to calendar data

### Google Agent Implementation (Importance: 80)
`src/zerozen/integrations/google/google_agent.py`
- Specialized agent for Google service interactions
- Privacy-focused system prompts
- Integration of Gmail and Calendar tools
- User consent management for data access

### Integration Orchestration (Importance: 75)
`src/zerozen/integrations/google/main.py`
- Coordination of Google service tools
- Authentication flow management
- Tool initialization and configuration
- Service access control

## Demo Implementations

### Desktop OAuth Flow (Importance: 70)
`examples/desktop_oauth_demo.py`
- Desktop-based authentication implementation
- Local credential storage handling
- Token refresh demonstration

### Google Agent Usage (Importance: 70)
`examples/google_agent_demo.py`
- Example implementations of Google agent workflows
- Service integration demonstrations
- Privacy-aware data access patterns
