# Change log

This change log follows the [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
recommendations. Every release contains the following sections:

- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed` for now removed features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

The versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for the
`protokolo` CLI command and its behaviour. There are no guarantees of stability
for the `protokolo` Python library.

## 3.0.2 - 2025-09-21

### Changed

- Relicensed from `GPL-3.0-or-later` to `EUPL-1.2+`.

### Fixed

- Removed version upper bound of Python requirement. That is, Protokolo no
  longer requires `>=3.11,<4`, and instead only requires `>=3.11`.

## 3.0.0 - 2024-07-13

### Changed

- Fragments are now sorted by file name stem instead of file name.

## 2.1.4 - 2024-04-30

### Fixed

- Changed the docs dependency for `sphinxcontrib-apidoc` from `^0.3.0` to
  `>=0.3.0`.
- Order of items in API documentation is now identical to how they are ordered
  in the source code.
- `protokolo compile --help` missed a paragraph. Instead of adding the
  paragraph, a lot of `--help` text has been moved into the accompanying
  manpages.

## 2.1.3 - 2024-04-28

### Fixed

- Don't show change log in overview page in Sphinx. This bug was introduced in
  v2.1.0.

## 2.1.2 - 2024-04-28

### Fixed

- Fix error in change log.

## 2.1.1 - 2024-04-28

### Added

- Implemented internationalisation via Weblate and Forgejo Actions.

### Fixed

- Documentation built from sdist now includes the change log and readme.

## 2.1.0 - 2024-04-28 [YANKED]

This release accidentally contained an older sdist.

## 2.0.1 - 2024-04-10

### Fixed

- `--directory` in `protokolo compile` now has a help text.
- `protokolo --version` now also prints the GPLv3+ blurb.

## 2.0.0 - 2024-04-10

### Added

- Wrote man pages, improved documentation.
- The options `--changelog`, `--directory`, and `--markup` now also take the
  short options `-c`, `-d`, and `-m` respectively.
- The option `--format` now also has the short option `-f`.

### Changed

- `protokolo compile` now takes the change log directory as a `--directory`
  option instead of as an argument. This makes it consistent with
  `protokolo init`.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where, if a subdirectory in `changelog.d` did not contain a
  `.protokolo.toml` file, the program would crash.
- Made sure that `changelog.d` subdirectories that do not contain a
  `.protokolo.toml` file retain all their files after `protokolo compile` is
  run.
- In `protokolo compile --help`, there was a `TODO` where a link to the
  documentation should have been.

## 1.0.1 - 2024-04-09

### Fixed

- Include `docs/` in the sdist.

## 1.0.0 - 2024-04-09

### Changed

- Renamed the concept of 'entry' to 'fragment'.
- Changed the way newlines are handled for fragments. Newlines surrounding
  fragments are now significant when concatenation of fragments happens.
  However, a _lack_ of final is considered an error, and one is always added.
  The foremost consequence of this change is that list items now concatenate
  without a blank line between them.

### Fixed

- Newline at the end of CHANGELOG is retained after `protokolo compile`.

## 0.3.0 - 2024-04-07

### Added

- Added `--dry-run` to `compile`.
- Added `--format` to `compile`. This is primarily useful for doing something
  like `protokolo compile --format version 1.0.0` to format the correct version
  into the section heading.

### Changed

- Re-wrote the internals to use the `attrs` library for easier validation.

## 0.2.0 - 2023-11-07

This is the prototype release of Protokolo. It contains the most basic
functionality and limited documentation, but is a minimum viable product. You
can:

- Compile the `changelog.d` directory into a CHANGELOG file with
  `protokolo compile`.
- Create the `changelog.d` directory with `protokolo init`.
- Configure some bits and bobs in `.protokolo.toml` files.
- Use both Markdown and reStructuredText.

## 0.1.0 - 2023-10-20

This release doesn't contain much of anything. I made it to claim the namespace
on PyPI.
