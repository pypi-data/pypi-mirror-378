Protokolo is a change log generator.

Protokolo allows you to maintain your change log fragments in separate files,
and then finally aggregate them into a new section in CHANGELOG just before
release.

## Background

Change logs are [a really good idea](https://keepachangelog.com/).
Unfortunately, they are also a bit of a pain when combined with version control:

- Different merge requests all edit the same area in CHANGELOG, inevitably
  resulting in merge conflicts.
- If a section for an unreleased version does not yet exist in the main branch's
  CHANGELOG (typically shortly after release), feature branches must create this
  section. If multiple feature branches do this, you get more merge conflicts.
- Old merge requests, when merged, sometimes add their change log entry to the
  section of a release that is already published.

Life would be a lot easier if you didn't have to deal with these problems.

Enter Protokolo
([Esperanto for 'report' or 'minutes'](https://vortaro.net/#protokolo)). The
idea is very simple: for every change log entry, create a new file. Finally,
just before release, compile the contents of those files into a new section in
CHANGELOG, and delete the files.

### See also

[Towncrier](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier) is an older and more widely
used implementation of the same idea. Protokolo is distinct in that it uses a
directory hierarchy instead of putting all metadata in the file name of each
change log fragment. Furthermore, Protokolo does no fancy formatting of
fragments---what you write is what you get.

There are three main problems I encountered in Towncrier that Protokolo attempts
to address:

- When using Towncrier, I would always forget which fragment types are available
  to me and had to look them up. These fragment types can also differ per
  repository. In Protokolo, the types are always visible because they are
  directories.
- Towncrier fragments are sorted by their ID, which is typically an issue or PR
  number. This isn't always what I want.
- Because (some) Towncrier workflows put the PR number in the file name as
  metadata, I would have to open the PR before I could create the change log
  fragment.

A much younger version of me also tried her hand at writing a program like this
in [changelogdir](https://pypi.org/project/changelogdir/).

## Install

Protokolo is a regular Python package
[hosted on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/protokolo). You can install it
using `pipx install protokolo`. Make sure that `~/.local/share/bin` is in your
`$PATH` with `pipx ensurepath`.

## Usage

For full documentation and options, read the documentation at
<https://protokolo.readthedocs.io>.

### Initial set-up

To set up your project for use with Protokolo, run `protokolo init`. This will
create a `CHANGELOG.md` file (if one did not already exist) and a directory
structure under `changelog.d`. The directory structure uses the
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) sections, and ends up looking
like this:

```
.
├── changelog.d
│   ├── added
│   │   └── .protokolo.toml
│   ├── changed
│   │   └── .protokolo.toml
│   ├── deprecated
│   │   └── .protokolo.toml
│   ├── fixed
│   │   └── .protokolo.toml
│   ├── removed
│   │   └── .protokolo.toml
│   ├── security
│   │   └── .protokolo.toml
│   └── .protokolo.toml
├── CHANGELOG.md
└── .protokolo.toml
```

The `.protokolo.toml` files in `changelog.d` contain metadata for their
respective sections: the section title, heading level, and order. Their
inclusion is mandatory.

The `.protokolo.toml` file in the root of the project contains configurations
for Protokolo that reduce the amount of typing you need to do when running
commands.

If a `CHANGELOG.md` file already existed, make sure to add a line containing
`<!-- protokolo-section-tag -->` just before the heading of the latest release.

### Adding fragments

To add a change log fragment, create the file `changelog.d/added/my_feature.md`,
and write something like:

```markdown
- Added `--my-new-feature` option.
```

Note the bullet at the start---Protokolo does not add them for you. What you
write is exactly what you get.

You can add more files. Change log fragments in the same section (read:
directory) are sorted alphabetically by their file name. If you want to make
certain that some change log fragments go first or last, prefix the file with
`000_` or `zzz_`. For example, you can create
`changelog.d/added/000_important_feature.md` to make it appear first.

### Compiling your change log

You compile your change log with `protokolo compile`. This will take all change
log fragments from `changelog.d` and put them in your `CHANGELOG.md`. If we run
it now, the following section is added after the
`<!-- protokolo-section-tag -->` comment:

```markdown
## ${version} - 2023-11-08

### Added

- Added important feature.
- Added `--my-new-feature` option.
```

The Markdown files in `changelog.d/added/` are deleted. You can manually replace
`${version}` with a release version, or you can pass the option
`--format version 1.0.0` to `protokolo compile` to format the heading at compile
time.
