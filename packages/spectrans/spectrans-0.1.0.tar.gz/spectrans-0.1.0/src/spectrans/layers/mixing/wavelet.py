r"""Wavelet-based mixing layers for spectral transformer networks.

Implements neural network layers that perform token mixing operations through
discrete wavelet transforms (DWT). The wavelet domain provides decomposition of
signals into approximation and detail coefficients at multiple resolution levels,
structuring processing of different frequency components.

Wavelet mixing layers apply learnable transformations to wavelet coefficients
before reconstruction, providing an alternative to attention mechanisms with
different inductive biases. The multi-scale nature of wavelets suits signals
with hierarchical structure.

>>> x = torch.randn(32, 256, 64, 64)
>>> output = mixer_2d(x)

Notes
-----
Mathematical Foundation:

The discrete wavelet transform decomposes a signal $\mathbf{x}$ into approximation
coefficients $\mathbf{c}_A$ and detail coefficients $\{\mathbf{c}_{D_j}\}_{j=1}^J$ at $J$ levels:

$$
\text{DWT}(\mathbf{x}) = \{\mathbf{c}_{A_J}, \{\mathbf{c}_{D_j}\}_{j=1}^J\}
$$

The decomposition uses filter banks with low-pass filter $\mathbf{h}$ and high-pass
filter $\mathbf{g}$:

$$
\mathbf{c}_{A_{j+1}}[k] = \sum_m \mathbf{h}[m-2k] \mathbf{c}_{A_j}[m]
$$

$$
\mathbf{c}_{D_{j+1}}[k] = \sum_m \mathbf{g}[m-2k] \mathbf{c}_{A_j}[m]
$$

Wavelet mixing applies learnable transformations to these coefficients through pointwise
mixing with element-wise scaling, channel mixing with linear transformations across feature
dimensions, and level mixing with cross-scale interactions using attention mechanisms.

Time complexity is $O(nd)$ for $n$-length signals with $d$ channels. Space complexity is
$O(nd)$ for coefficient storage. Decomposition typically uses 1-5 levels depending on signal
length.

Daubechies wavelets provide compact support with localization. Symlets are symmetric with
reduced phase distortion. Coiflets balance time-frequency resolution. Biorthogonal wavelets
enable perfect reconstruction with linear phase.

All wavelet operations maintain gradient flow for end-to-end training. The transforms use
PyTorch-native implementations compatible with automatic differentiation, avoiding external
library dependencies that could break gradient computation.

class WaveletMixing(nn.Module):
    r"""Token mixing layer using discrete wavelet transform.

    Performs mixing in wavelet domain for multi-resolution processing.
    Decomposes input using DWT, applies learnable mixing to coefficients,
    and reconstructs the output with residual connections.

    Mathematical Formulation
    ------------------------
    Given input tensor $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times N \times D}$ where $B$ is batch size,
    $N$ is sequence length, and $D$ is hidden dimension:

    **Step 1: Channel-wise Decomposition**

    For each channel $d \in \{0, 1, \ldots, D-1\}$, extract the channel signal:

    $$
    \mathbf{x}^{(d)} = \mathbf{X}[:, :, d] \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times N}
    $$

    Apply $J$-level DWT decomposition:

    $$
    \text{DWT}_J(\mathbf{x}^{(d)}) = \{\mathbf{c}_{A_J}^{(d)}, \{\mathbf{c}_{D_j}^{(d)}\}_{j=1}^J\}
    $$

    Where:
    - $\mathbf{c}_{A_J}^{(d)} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L_{A_J}}$ are approximation coefficients at level $J$
    - $\mathbf{c}_{D_j}^{(d)} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times L_{D_j}}$ are detail coefficients at level $j$
    - $L_{A_J}$ and $L_{D_j}$ are coefficient lengths after subsampling

    **Step 2: Learnable Mixing**

    Apply mixing transformations based on mode:

    *Pointwise Mixing* (:code:`mixing_mode='pointwise'`):

    $$
    \tilde{\mathbf{c}}_{A_J}^{(d)} = \mathbf{c}_{A_J}^{(d)} \odot \mathbf{W}_{A}[:, :L_{A_J}, d]
    $$

    $$
    \tilde{\mathbf{c}}_{D_j}^{(d)} = \mathbf{c}_{D_j}^{(d)} \odot \mathbf{W}_{D_j}[:, :L_{D_j}, d]
    $$

    Where $\mathbf{W}_{A}, \mathbf{W}_{D_j} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times \max(L) \times D}$ are learnable parameters,
    and $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication with broadcasting.

    *Channel Mixing* (:code:`mixing_mode='channel'`):

    $$
    \tilde{\mathbf{c}}_{A_J}^{(d)} = \mathbf{c}_{A_J}^{(d)} \cdot \mathbf{W}_{A}[0, d, d]
    $$

    $$
    \tilde{\mathbf{c}}_{D_j}^{(d)} = \mathbf{c}_{D_j}^{(d)} \cdot \mathbf{W}_{D_j}[0, d, d]
    $$

    Where $\mathbf{W}_{A}, \mathbf{W}_{D_j} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times D \times D}$ are initialized as identity matrices.

    *Level Mixing* (:code:`mixing_mode='level'`):

    Cross-level attention is applied to all coefficients simultaneously:

    $$
    \{\tilde{\mathbf{c}}_{A_J}^{(d)}, \{\tilde{\mathbf{c}}_{D_j}^{(d)}\}_{j=1}^J\} = \text{MultiHeadAttn}(\text{Concat}(\mathbf{c}_{A_J}^{(d)}, \{\mathbf{c}_{D_j}^{(d)}\}))
    $$

    **Step 3: Reconstruction**

    Reconstruct the signal using inverse DWT:

    $$
    \tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{(d)} = \text{IDWT}_J(\{\tilde{\mathbf{c}}_{A_J}^{(d)}, \{\tilde{\mathbf{c}}_{D_j}^{(d)}\}_{j=1}^J\})
    $$

    Apply length adjustment if necessary:

    $$
    \hat{\mathbf{x}}^{(d)} = \begin{cases}
    \tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{(d)}[:, :N] & \text{if } |\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{(d)}| > N \\
    \text{Pad}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{(d)}, N) & \text{if } |\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{(d)}| < N \\
    \tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{(d)} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
    $$

    **Step 4: Residual Connection and Dropout**

    Combine all channels and apply residual connection:

    $$
    \hat{\mathbf{X}} = \text{Concat}(\{\hat{\mathbf{x}}^{(d)}\}_{d=0}^{D-1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times N \times D}
    $$

    $$
    \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X} + \text{Dropout}(\hat{\mathbf{X}})
    $$

    Complexity Analysis
    -------------------
    - **Time Complexity**: $O(NJ) + O(D \cdot N \log N)$ per forward pass

        - $O(N)$ for DWT/IDWT per level and channel (linear in signal length)
        - $O(DJ)$ for mixing operations across all levels and channels
        - Dominated by DWT operations when $J$ is small

    - **Space Complexity**: $O(DN + P)$ where $P$ is parameter count

        - $O(DN)$ for storing coefficient tensors
        - Parameter count depends on mixing mode:
            - Pointwise: $P = O(LD)$ where $L$ is max coefficient length
            - Channel: $P = O(JD^2)$
            - Level: $P = O(D^2)$ for attention parameters

    Implementation Notes
    --------------------
    - Uses PyTorch-native DWT implementation for gradient compatibility
    - Dynamic weight slicing ensures proper alignment with variable-length coefficients
    - Perfect reconstruction property maintained through careful length handling
    - Each channel processed independently for computational efficiency

    Performs mixing in 2D wavelet domain, suitable for vision transformers
    and other architectures processing 2D spatial data. Processes spatial
    information through multi-resolution wavelet subbands.

    Mathematical Formulation
    ------------------------
    Given input tensor $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times C \times H \times W}$ where $B$ is batch size,
    $C$ is channels, $H$ is height, and $W$ is width:

    **Step 1: Channel-wise 2D Decomposition**

    For each channel $c \in \{0, 1, \ldots, C-1\}$, extract spatial data:

    $$
    \mathbf{X}^{(c)} = \mathbf{X}[:, c, :, :] \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times H \times W}
    $$

    Apply $J$-level 2D DWT decomposition:

    $$
    \text{DWT2D}_J(\mathbf{X}^{(c)}) = \{\mathbf{LL}_J^{(c)}, \{(\mathbf{LH}_j^{(c)}, \mathbf{HL}_j^{(c)}, \mathbf{HH}_j^{(c)})\}_{j=1}^J\}
    $$

    Where:
    - $\mathbf{LL}_J^{(c)} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times H_J \times W_J}$ is the approximation subband (low-low)
    - $\mathbf{LH}_j^{(c)}, \mathbf{HL}_j^{(c)}, \mathbf{HH}_j^{(c)} \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times H_j \times W_j}$ are detail subbands
    - $H_j = \frac{H}{2^j}$, $W_j = \frac{W}{2^j}$ are spatial dimensions at level $j$

    **Step 2: Subband Mixing**

    Apply mixing transformations based on mode:

    *Subband Mixing* (:code:`mixing_mode='subband'`):

    Independent processing of each subband using convolutional networks:

    $$

    Where $f_{\cdot}$ are learnable convolutional transformations.

    *Cross Mixing* (:code:`mixing_mode='cross'`):

    Cross-attention across all subbands:

    $$
    \{\tilde{\mathbf{LL}}_J^{(c)}, \{\tilde{\mathbf{LH}}_j^{(c)}, \tilde{\mathbf{HL}}_j^{(c)}, \tilde{\mathbf{HH}}_j^{(c)}\}\} = \text{CrossAttn}(\text{AllSubbands}^{(c)})
    $$

    **Step 3: 2D Reconstruction**

    Reconstruct the spatial signal:

    $$
    \tilde{\mathbf{X}}^{(c)} = \text{IDWT2D}_J(\{\tilde{\mathbf{LL}}_J^{(c)}, \{\tilde{\mathbf{LH}}_j^{(c)}, \tilde{\mathbf{HL}}_j^{(c)}, \tilde{\mathbf{HH}}_j^{(c)}\}\})
    $$

    **Step 4: Channel Concatenation and Residual**

    $$
    \hat{\mathbf{X}} = \text{Stack}(\{\tilde{\mathbf{X}}^{(c)}\}_{c=0}^{C-1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times C \times H \times W}
    $$

    $$
    \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X} + \hat{\mathbf{X}}
    $$

    Complexity Analysis
    -------------------

    - Subband: $O(\text{conv operations per subband})$
    - Cross: $O(\text{attention across subbands})$
    - Attention: $O(\text{transformer encoder})$

    levels : int, default=2
        Number of decomposition levels $J$.
    mixing_mode : str, default='subband'
        Subband mixing strategy: 'subband' (independent), 'cross' (attention), 'attention' (transformer).

        Implements complete 2D wavelet mixing: spatial decomposition â subband mixing â
        reconstruction â residual connection. Each channel is processed independently.

        Mathematical Implementation
        ---------------------------
        1. **Channel Extraction**: $\mathbf{X}^{(c)} = \mathbf{X}[:, c, :, :]$ for each channel $c$
        2. **2D Wavelet Decomposition**: $\text{DWT2D}_J(\mathbf{X}^{(c)}) \rightarrow \text{subbands}$
        3. **Subband Mixing**: Apply mode-specific transformations to wavelet subbands
        4. **2D Reconstruction**: $\text{IDWT2D}_J(\text{mixed subbands}) \rightarrow \tilde{\mathbf{X}}^{(c)}$
        5. **Channel Stacking**: $\hat{\mathbf{X}} = [\tilde{\mathbf{X}}^{(0)}, \ldots, \tilde{\mathbf{X}}^{(C-1)}]$
        6. **Residual Connection**: $\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X} + \hat{\mathbf{X}}$

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : Tensor
            Input tensor of shape $(B, C, H, W)$ where:

            - $B$ is batch size
            - $C$ is number of channels
            - $H$ is height
            - $W$ is width

        Notes
        -----
        - Spatial dimensions preserved through careful reconstruction handling
        - Different mixing strategies provide various inductive biases
        - Subband mode: Independent processing emphasizes local features
        - Cross mode: Attention enables global subband interactions
        - Attention mode: Full transformer encoder for complex dependencies
