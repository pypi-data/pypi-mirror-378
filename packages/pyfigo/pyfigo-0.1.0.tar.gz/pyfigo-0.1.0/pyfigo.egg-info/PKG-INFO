#### Could it be faster?

Try the function `figo.afap('file.fits')` to go as fast as possible.


#### Can I get a keyword other than `OBJECT`?

No. [_Do one thing and do it well_](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).

#### Is it standard compliant?

Yes!

#### Does it work on Windows?

Why wouldn't it? ðŸ¤¨
