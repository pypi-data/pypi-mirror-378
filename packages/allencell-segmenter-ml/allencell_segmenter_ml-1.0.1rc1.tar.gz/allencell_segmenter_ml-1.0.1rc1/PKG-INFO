# Allencell-segmenter-ml

[![Test and lint](https://github.com/AllenCell/allencell-segmenter-ml/actions/workflows/test_lint.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/AllenCell/allencell-segmenter-ml/actions/workflows/test_lint_pr.yaml)


## What is Allen Cell Segmenter ML
A napari plugin for deep-learning based segmentation of cellular structures.

![SegmenterML-plugin_fig1_output.png](docs%2Fuser_docs%2Fimages%2FSegmenterML-plugin_fig1_output.png)

- **Available at no cost** ‚Äî available on PyPI
- **User-friendly** ‚Äî leverage napari as a fast 3D viewer with interactive plugin interface
- **Beginner-friendly** ‚Äî new to machine learning? This plugin simplifies the application of machine learning in the segmentation process through the 3 main modules:
  - **Curation**: curate training datasets
  - **Training**: iteratively train custom segmentation model(s) (UNET) to target cellular structure with wide morphological variability
  - **Prediction & Thresholding**: generate segmentation prediction on 2D and 3D cell image data


##  üì∞ News

 - **[2024.09.24]** :tada: Initial release of the plugin and Megaseg models!
 - **[2024.05.29]** :tada: v1.0.0 Released on PyPi
