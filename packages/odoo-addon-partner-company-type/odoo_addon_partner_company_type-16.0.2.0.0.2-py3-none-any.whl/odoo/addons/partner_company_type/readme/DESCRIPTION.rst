This module allows configuring Legal Entity Types (Partner Company Types) and assigning
them to company contacts. Each company can only be assigned to one Legal Entity Type.

Each country can have a predefined list of legal entity types (also at specific country
state level). This is also covered by this module by allowing to relate each type
to one or multiple countries and states (some may be shared across multiple
countries/states).
