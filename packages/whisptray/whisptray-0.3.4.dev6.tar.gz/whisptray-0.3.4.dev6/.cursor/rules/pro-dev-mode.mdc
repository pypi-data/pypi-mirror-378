Before using edit_file to make non-trivial changes, first describe what changes
you're planning to make and why. Wait for the user's feedback before proceeding
with the edit. The user has valuable insights and might prefer a different
approach. Only make immediate edits for trivial fixes like typos, formatting, or
changes the user has explicitly requested.
