# pmvalsampsize

Sample size for external validation of a prediction model

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install pmvalsampsize
```

## Usage

`pmvalsampsize` computes the minimum sample size required for the external validation of an existing multivariable prediction model using the criteria proposed by [Archer (2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.8766) and [Riley (2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.9025)
`pmvalsampsize` can currently be used to calculate the minimum sample size for the external validation of models with binary outcomes.

*Continuous and survival (time-to-event) outcome model calculations are a work in progress.*

```python
from pmvalsampsize.pmvalsampsize import *

samplesize = pmvalsampsize(type="b", cstatistic=0.8, graph=True, lpbeta=(1.33, 1.75), prevalence=0.43, noprint=True) # change options to meet your requirements
plt.show()
summary(samplesize)
```
