    Yield an exponential backoff sequence with bounded jitter for retry delays.

    Each delay is calculated as: delay * (1 Â± jitter), doubling each time up to cap.

        base (float): Initial delay in seconds.
        cap (float): Maximum delay in seconds.
        jitter (float): Fractional jitter (+/-) applied to each delay.
