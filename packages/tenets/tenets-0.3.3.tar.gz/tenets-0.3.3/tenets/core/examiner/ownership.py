"""Code ownership tracking module for examination.

This module analyzes code ownership patterns by examining git history,
identifying primary contributors, tracking knowledge distribution, and
detecting bus factor risks. It helps understand team dynamics and
knowledge silos within a codebase.

The ownership tracker integrates with git to provide insights into who
knows what parts of the code and where knowledge gaps might exist.
