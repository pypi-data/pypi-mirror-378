## LBM - TRI (wip)

Implementation of the [Large Behavioral Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYwekersccY) architecture for [dexterous manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05331) from Toyota Research Institute.

## Install

```shell
$ pip install TRI-LBM
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from TRI_LBM import LBM

lbm = LBM(
    action_dim = 20,
    dim_pose = 10
)

commands = ['pick up the apple and place in the blue tray']
images = torch.randn(1, 3, 3, 224, 224)
actions = torch.randn(1, 16, 20)
pose = torch.randn(1, 10)

loss = lbm(
    text = commands,
    images = images,
    pose = pose,
    actions = actions,
)

loss.backward()

# after much training

sampled_actions = lbm.sample(
    text = commands,
    images = images,
    pose = pose,
) # (1, 16, 20)
```
