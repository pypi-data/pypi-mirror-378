# Production Rule System Implementation

This implementation addresses the requirements from the problem statement to convert "learned patterns" into production-ready rules with proper gating and KPI metrics.

## Key Features Implemented

### 🚪 RuleOps System with G1-G5 Gates
- **G1 - Precision Gate**: No >1 FP across 200+ safe contracts
- **G2 - Recall Gate**: ≥70% on known positives from public audits  
- **G3 - Severity Gate**: Maps to taxonomy with rationale
- **G4 - Time Budget**: <100ms per file for the rule
- **G5 - Reproducibility**: Identical output on same commit

### 📊 Comprehensive KPIs (Replacing "accuracy = 0.39")
- **Recall@High+** ≥ 80% (first target), 85% (stretch)
- **Precision@High+** ≥ 80%
- **Severity-weighted F1** ≥ 0.85 (weights Crit=4, High=3, Med=2, Low=1)
- **Time-to-first-High** ≤ 120s on mid-size repos
- **Determinism**: Identical JSON on same commit

### 🔍 Deterministic Vulnerability Detectors
1. **Oracle Staleness**: Detects `latestRoundData()` usage without freshness checks
2. **Cross-chain Replay**: Finds message handlers missing nonce/domain validation
3. **UUPS Initializer**: Identifies missing initializer guards in upgradeable contracts
4. **Governance Takeover**: Detects admin roles that control both params and execution

### 📋 YAML Rule Specification
```yaml
id: OR-STALE-01
name: oracle_staleness_exploit
category: Oracle.Staleness
severity: High
signal:
  requires:
    - interface_present: "AggregatorV3Interface"
  patterns_any:
    - "latestRoundData("
  anti_patterns:
    - "timestamp"
    - "maxAge"
performance_budget_ms: 100
gates:
  - gate_id: "G1"
    name: "Precision Gate"
    threshold: 1.0
```

## Quick Start

### Run Production System Demo
```bash
python rule_system_demo.py --target tests/corpus/positive --validate-gates
```

### Run Full Demonstration
```bash
python final_demonstration.py
```

### Run Tests
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_custom_rules.py -v
```

## Architecture

### Core Components
- `core/detection_engines/custom_rules/rule_ops.py` - RuleOps system with gating
- `core/detection_engines/custom_rules/kpi_metrics.py` - KPI calculation engine
- `core/detection_engines/custom_rules/oracle_staleness.py` - Oracle staleness detector
- `core/detection_engines/custom_rules/crosschain_replay.py` - Cross-chain replay detector
- `production_rules/*.yaml` - YAML rule definitions

### Test Infrastructure
- `tests/corpus/positive/` - Vulnerable contract examples
- `tests/corpus/negative/` - Safe contract examples  
- `tests/test_custom_rules.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Integration Points

The system is designed to integrate with existing vulnerability learning infrastructure:

1. **Rule Promotion Pipeline**: Automatically promote learned patterns that pass all gates
2. **KPI Reporting**: Replace basic accuracy metrics with comprehensive production KPIs
3. **Validation Framework**: Test against real audit data and exploit corpus
4. **Performance Budgeting**: Ensure <100ms per file execution time

## Status

✅ **Implemented**:
- RuleOps gating system (G1-G5)
- KPI metrics framework
- 4 deterministic vulnerability detectors
- YAML rule specification
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance budgeting

🚧 **In Progress**:
- Remaining 4 vulnerability detectors (ERC4626, MEV, Permit, Bridge)
- CI integration for automated rule promotion
- Integration with existing vulnerability learner
