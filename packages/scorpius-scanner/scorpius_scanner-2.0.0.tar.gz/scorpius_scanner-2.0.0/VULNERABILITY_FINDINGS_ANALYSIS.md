## üß™ VULNERABILITY PATTERN ANALYSIS

### Reentrancy Detection
- **Scorpius**: 4 instances detected (including complex patterns)
- **Slither**: 1 instance detected (when functional)
- **Winner**: Scorpius - better pattern recognition

### Overflow/Underflow
- **Scorpius**: 6 instances detected across multiple contracts
- **Slither**: 0 traditional overflow detections
- **Winner**: Scorpius - modern vulnerability focus

### DeFi-Specific Vulnerabilities
- **Oracle Manipulation**: Scorpius detected, Slither failed to analyze
- **Governance Attacks**: Scorpius detected, Slither missed
- **Flash Loan Issues**: Both detected different aspects

## üéØ CONFIDENCE AND ACCURACY

### Scorpius Confidence Scores
- High confidence (0.85-0.95): 8 vulnerabilities
- Medium confidence (0.75): 7 vulnerabilities
- Average confidence: 0.82

### Slither Confidence Levels
- High confidence: 1 vulnerability
- Medium confidence: 6 vulnerabilities
- Mixed confidence levels across findings

## üîç FALSE POSITIVE ANALYSIS

**Note**: This benchmark focused on known vulnerable contracts, so most findings represent real vulnerabilities rather than false positives.

### Potential False Positives
- Some overflow detections may be in safe contexts
- Pattern-based detection may flag intentional behaviors
- Traditional static analysis may miss context

### Validation Needed
- Manual review of all findings recommended
- Exploit verification for critical findings
- Context analysis for business logic

## üöÄ PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS

### Speed vs Accuracy Trade-off
- **Scorpius**: Fast (0.35s avg) with comprehensive coverage
- **Slither**: Slower (0.49s avg) when working, but frequent failures

### Scalability Implications
- **Scorpius**: Consistent performance across contract types
- **Slither**: Variable performance, environment-dependent
