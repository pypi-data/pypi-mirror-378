Subject: Upcoming Security Audit

The security audit scheduled for next month will focus on our API key management.
Please ensure all systems are using the new key rotation policy.

Current Production API Keys:
- Main API: api_prod_8a7b6c5d4e3f2g1h
- Payment Gateway: pg_live_9i8u7y6t5r4e3w2q
- Analytics Service: as_prod_2p3o4i5u6y7t8r9e

These keys will be rotated after the audit.

Regards,
Security Team
