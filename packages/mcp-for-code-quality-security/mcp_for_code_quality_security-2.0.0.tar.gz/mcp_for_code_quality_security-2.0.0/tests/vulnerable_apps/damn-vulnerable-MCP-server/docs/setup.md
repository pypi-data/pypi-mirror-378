# Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up and running the Damn Vulnerable Model Context Protocol (DVMCP) challenges.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- node (Needed for running remote MCP server)
- A Model Context Protocol (MCP) client (e.g., Claude Desktop or MCP Inspector)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/damn-vulnerable-mcs.git
   cd damn-vulnerable-mcs
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Challenges

Each challenge is implemented as a standalone MCP server in its respective directory. To run a challenge:

1. Navigate to the challenge directory:
   ```
   cd challenges/easy/challenge1
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```
   python server.py
   ```

3. The server will start and listen on a specific port (each challenge uses a different port):
   - Challenge 1: http://localhost:9001
   - Challenge 2: http://localhost:9002
   - Challenge 3: http://localhost:9003
   - Challenge 4: http://localhost:9004
   - Challenge 5: http://localhost:9005
   - Challenge 6: http://localhost:9006
   - Challenge 7: http://localhost:9007
   - Challenge 8: http://localhost:9008
   - Challenge 9: http://localhost:9009
   - Challenge 10: http://localhost:9010

4. Connect to the server using an MCP client:
   -  Cline refer https://docs.cline.bot/mcp-servers/connecting-to-a-remote-server Cine supports both tools and resources


## MCP Client Options

### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop is a desktop application that allows you to interact with Claude and connect to MCP servers. You can download it from the Anthropic website.

Before changing the config file, make sure you have node installed. This prevents issues in Claude Desktop connecting to the remote MCP challenge servers.

**Mac Installation (in Terminal):**
```
   % brew install node
   % brew link node
```

**Windows Installation:** 

Navigate to https://nodejs.org/en/download and download the setup file for your system.

**Linux Installation (in Terminal):**

```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   sudo apt install nodejs
   sudo apt install npm [OPTIONALLY, IF NOT ALREADY INSTALLED WITH PREVIOUS COMMAND]
```

To connect to a challenge server:
1. Open **Claude Desktop**.
2. Go to `File → Settings... → Developer (Tab) → Edit Config`.
3. This will open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
4. Add your MCP server configuration like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Challenge 1": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://127.0.0.1:9001/sse"
      ]
    },
    "Challenge 2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://127.0.0.1:9002/sse"
      ]
    },

    [...]
    
    "Challenge 9": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://127.0.0.1:9010/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop.


#### Verifying the Connection

After restarting Claude, you should see a popup listing the available MCP tools provided by the configured servers.


### MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector is a development tool included with the MCP Python SDK. It allows you to inspect and interact with MCP servers.

To use the MCP Inspector:
1. Install the MCP Python SDK with the CLI tools:
   ```
   pip install "mcp[cli]"
   ```

2. Run the MCP Inspector:
   ```
   mcp dev http://localhost:8001
   ```

3. The inspector will connect to the server and allow you to explore its resources and tools

## Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts

If you encounter port conflicts (e.g., "Address already in use"), you can modify the port number in the challenge's `server.py` file. Look for the line:

```python
uvicorn.run(mcp.app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8001)
```

Change the port number to an available port.

### Dependency Issues

If you encounter dependency issues, try creating a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Server Connection Issues

If you have trouble connecting to the server:
1. Ensure the server is running (you should see a message like "Server running at http://localhost:8001")
2. Check if there are any firewall issues blocking the connection
3. Verify that you're using the correct URL in your MCP client

## Next Steps

Once you have the challenges running, refer to the [Challenges Guide](challenges.md) for details on each challenge and hints for solving them.
