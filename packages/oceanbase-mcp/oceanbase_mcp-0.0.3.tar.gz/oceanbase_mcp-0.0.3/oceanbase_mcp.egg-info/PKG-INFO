uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
```
### If you configure the OceanBase connection information using .env file. You should copy .env.template to .env and modify .env
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```
### If the dependency packages cannot be downloaded via uv due to network issues, you can change the mirror source to the Alibaba Cloud mirror source.
```bash
export UV_DEFAULT_INDEX="https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/"
```
### Install dependencies
```bash
uv pip install .
```
## Install from PyPI Repository
If you wish to use it via pip install, please execute the following command.
```bash
uv pip install oceanbase-mcp
```
## Configuration
There are two ways to configure the connection information of OceanBase
1. Set the following environment variables:

```bash
OB_HOST=localhost     # Database host
OB_PORT=2881         # Optional: Database port (defaults to 2881 if not specified)
OB_USER=your_username
OB_PASSWORD=your_password
OB_DATABASE=your_database
```
2. Configure in the .env file
## Usage

### Stdio Mode

Add the following content to the configuration file that supports the MCP server client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "oceanbase": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory", 
        "path/to/mcp-oceanbase/src/oceanbase_mcp_server",
        "run",
        "oceanbase_mcp_server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "OB_HOST": "localhost",
        "OB_PORT": "2881",
        "OB_USER": "your_username",
        "OB_PASSWORD": "your_password",
        "OB_DATABASE": "your_database"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### SSE Mode
Within the mcp-oceanbase directory, execute the following command, the port can be customized as desired.  
'--transport': MCP server transport type, default is stdio  
'--host': host to bind to, default is 127.0.0.1, that is to say, you can only access it on your local computer. If you want any remote client to be able to access it, you can set the host to 0.0.0.0  
'--port': port to listen on, default is 8000
```bash
uv run oceanbase_mcp_server --transport sse --port 8000
```
If you don't want to use uv, you can start it in the following way
```bash
cd oceanbase_mcp/ && python3 -m server --transport sse --port 8000
```
The URL address for the general SSE mode configuration is `http://ip:port/sse`

### Streamable HTTP
Within the mcp-oceanbase directory, execute the following command, the port can be customized as desired.  
'--transport': MCP server transport type, default is stdio  
'--host': host to bind to, default is 127.0.0.1, that is to say, you can only access it on your local computer. If you want any remote client to be able to access it, you can set the host to 0.0.0.0  
'--port': port to listen on, default is 8000
```bash
uv run oceanbase_mcp_server --transport streamable-http --port 8000
```
If you don't want to use uv, you can start it in the following way
```bash
cd oceanbase_mcp/ && python3 -m server --transport streamable-http --port 8000
```
The URL address for the general Streamable HTTP mode configuration is `http://ip:port/mcp`

#### VSCode Extension Cline Sample Configuration
```json
"streamable-ob": {
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "http://ip:port/mcp"
    }
```
#### Cursor Sample Configuration
```json
"streamable-ob": {
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "streamableHttp", // “type”: “http” is also acceptable
      "url": "http://ip:port/mcp"
    }
```
#### Cherry Studio Sample Configuration
MCP->General->Type, select Streamable HTTP (streamableHttp) from the dropdown menu.

### Authorization
The ALLOWED_TOKENS variable can be configured in environment variables or an env file. Then, add “Authorization”: “Bearer \<token\>” to the request header of the MCP Client. Only requests carrying a valid token can access the MCP server service. Multiple tokens can be separated by commas.  
For Example:
```
ALLOWED_TOKENS=tokenOne,tokenTwo
``` 
#### CherryStudio 
Add `Authorization=Bearer <token>` to the MCP->General->Headers input field.
#### Cursor
In the MCP configuration file, configure it as follows:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ob-sse": {
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60,
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://ip:port/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
#### Cline
Cline does not support setting Authorization in request headers.

### 🧠 AI Memory System

**Experimental Feature**: Transform your AI assistant with persistent vector-based memory powered by OceanBase's advanced vector capabilities.

The memory system enables your AI to maintain continuous context across conversations, eliminating the need to repeat personal preferences and information. Four intelligent tools work together to create a seamless memory experience:

- **`ob_memory_query`** - Semantically search and retrieve contextual memories
- **`ob_memory_insert`** - Automatically capture and store important conversations  
- **`ob_memory_delete`** - Remove outdated or unwanted memories
- **`ob_memory_update`** - Evolve memories with new information over time

#### 🚀 Quick Setup

Memory tools are **disabled by default** to avoid the initial embedding model download (0.5~4 GiB). Enable intelligent memory with these environment variables:

```bash
ENABLE_MEMORY=1  # default 0 disabled， set 1 to enable
EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 # default BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5, You can set BAAI/bge-m3 or other models to get better experience.
EMBEDDING_MODEL_PROVIDER=huggingface
```

#### 📋 Prerequisites

**Vector Support**: Requires OceanBase v4.3.5.3+ (vector features enabled by default)

```bash
sudo docker run -p 2881:2881 --name obvector -e MODE=mini -d oceanbase/oceanbase-ce:4.3.5.3-103000092025080818
```

**Legacy Versions**: For older OceanBase versions, manually configure [ob_vector_memory_limit_percentage](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000003381620).

#### ⬇️ Dependency Installation
If you use source code Installation, use the following command to install dependencies
```bash
cd path/to/mcp-oceanbase/src/oceanbase_mcp_server
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --extra memory
```
If pip Installation
```bash
uv pip install oceanbase-mcp[memory] --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

#### 💡 Usage Example

Experience the power of cross-session intelligent memory:

```
📅 Monday Conversation
User: "I love football and basketball, but I don't like swimming. I work in Shanghai using Python."

### Example 6: Search for documents using full text search
Question:
```
Find content in t2 table that mention "apple"
```
Answer:
```
I have successfully queried the documents in the content field of table t2 that mention "apple". Here are the results:

1. Document ID: 2, Author: john, Age: 20, Content: I have a pear and an apple
2. Document ID: 1, Author: david, Age: 19, Content: I have a pineapple and an apple
3. Document ID: 3, Author: tom, Age: 21, Content: I also have a pear and an apple
```
### Example 7: Search records by vector similarity
Question:
```
Please search for records in table t2 that are close to the vector [0.1, 0.1, 0.1].
```
Answer:
```
The vector search on table t2 has returned results successfully. I can now analyze and present these results to the user.

The search found three records that are close to the vector [0.1, 0.1, 0.1]:

1. Record with id 2, name 'john', age 20, description 'I have a pear and an apple', vector '[0.1,0.1,0.2]', and distance 0.1
2. Record with id 3, name 'tom', age 21, description 'I also have a pear and an apple', vector '[0.1,0.1,0.2]', and distance 0.1
3. Record with id 1, name 'david', age 19, description 'I have a pineapple and an apple', vector '[0.1,0.2,0.3]', and distance 0.2236

These records are ordered by their distance from the search vector, with closer matches appearing first.
```
### Example 8: Perform hybird search
Perform hybird search combining relational condition filtering(that is, scalar) and vector search. 
Using both vectors and scalars as query conditions.  
Question:
```
Please find the record in table t2 that has a vector close to [0.1, 0.1, 0.2] and an age of 20.
```
Answer:
```
The record in table `t2` that has a vector close to `[0.1, 0.1, 0.2]` and an age of 20 is:
(2, 'john', 20, 'I have a pear and an apple', '[0.1,0.1,0.2]', 0.0)
```

## Security Considerations

- Never commit environment variables or credentials
- Use a database user with minimal required permissions
- Consider implementing query whitelisting for production use
- Monitor and log all database operations

## Security Best Practices

This MCP server requires database access to function. For security:

1. **Create a dedicated OceanBase user** with minimal permissions
2. **Never use root credentials** or administrative accounts
3. **Restrict database access** to only necessary operations
4. **Enable logging** for audit purposes
5. **Regular security reviews** of database access

See [OceanBase Security Configuration Guide](./SECURITY.md) for detailed instructions on:
- Creating a restricted OceanBase user
- Setting appropriate permissions
- Monitoring database access
- Security best practices

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always follow the principle of least privilege when configuring database access.
