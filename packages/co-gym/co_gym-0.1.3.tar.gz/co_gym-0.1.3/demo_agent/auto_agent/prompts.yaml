  Guidelines:
  1. Keep your scratchpad concise and relevant.
  2. If there is any information that could be useful for future steps but not in the scratchpad, add it to the scratchpad.
  3. If every information in the current observation is already in the scratchpad, you do not need to update the scratchpad.
  4. If a past action does not lead to any progress, consider updating the scratchpad to remind yourself of not repeating the same action.
