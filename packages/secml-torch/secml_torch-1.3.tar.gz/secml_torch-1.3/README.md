SecML-Torch (SecMLT) is an open-source Python library designed to facilitate research in the area of Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) and robustness evaluation.
The library provides a simple yet powerful interface for generating various types of adversarial examples, as well as tools for evaluating the robustness of machine learning models against such attacks.

## Installation

You can install SecMLT via pip:
```bash
pip install secml-torch
```

This will install the core version of SecMLT, including only the main functionalities such as native implementation of attacks and PyTorch wrappers.

### Install with extras

The library can be installed together with other plugins that enable further functionalities.

* [Foolbox](https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox), a Python toolbox to create adversarial examples.
* [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), a visualization toolkit for machine learning experimentation.
* [Adversarial Library](https://github.com/jeromerony/adversarial-library), a powerful library of various adversarial attacks resources in PyTorch.


Install one or more extras with the command:
```bash
pip install secml-torch[foolbox,tensorboard,adv_lib]
```

## Key Features

- **Built for Deep Learning:** SecMLT is compatible with the popular machine learning framework PyTorch.
- **Various types of adversarial attacks:** SecMLT includes support for a wide range of attack methods (evasion, poisoning, ...) such as different implementations imported from popular AML libraries (Foolbox, Adversarial Library).
- **Customizable attacks:** SecMLT offers several levels of analysis for the models, including modular implementations of existing attacks to extend with different loss functions, optimizers, and more.
- **Attack debugging:** Built-in debugging of evaluations by logging events and metrics along the attack runs (even on Tensorboard).

## Usage

Here's a brief example of using SecMLT to evaluate the robustness of a trained classifier:

```python
from secmlt.adv.evasion.pgd import PGD
from secmlt.metrics.classification import Accuracy
from secmlt.models.pytorch.base_pytorch_nn import BasePytorchClassifier


model = ...
torch_data_loader = ...

# Wrap model
model = BasePytorchClassifier(model)

# create and run attack
attack = PGD(
    perturbation_model="l2",
    epsilon=0.4,
    num_steps=100,
    step_size=0.01,
)

adversarial_loader = attack(model, torch_data_loader)

# Test accuracy on adversarial examples
robust_accuracy = Accuracy()(model, adversarial_loader)
```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the [official documentation](https://secml-torch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or to the [examples](https://github.com/pralab/secml-torch/tree/main/examples).
