# AI Agents Course from Towards AI and Decoding ML

This repository contains all the code exercises and project materials for the **AI Agents** course, created by **Towards AI** and **Decoding ML**. This course is designed for developers who want to move beyond basic LLM tutorials and build production-grade AI agents and workflows. It provides a hands-on, project-based approach to learning agentic architecture patterns, modern frameworks like LangGraph, and essential production skills like LLMOps, evaluation, and deployment.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized to help you easily find and follow along with the course materials.

  - **`lessons/`**: This directory contains all the code notebooks (`.ipynb` files) for the course lessons. Each lesson has its own folder (e.g., `01_ai_agents_landscape/`).
  - **`utils/`**: Helper scripts and utility functions used in the notebooks.
  - **`.env.example`**: A template file for your environment variables.
  - **`pyproject.toml`**: The main configuration file for project dependencies.
  - **`uv.lock`**: A lock file generated by `uv` to ensure a reproducible environment.

### Getting Started: Running the Notebooks

To run the course notebooks, you'll need to set up your local environment. Follow these steps to get everything installed and configured.

#### 1\. Install Git and `uv`

First, make sure you have **Git** and the **`uv`** package manager installed.

  - [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/): This is used to clone the repository.
  - [**`uv`**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv): A modern, high-speed Python package manager that will handle all dependencies for this project.

#### 2\. Clone the Repository

Clone the course repository as described in the admin lesson of the course. It uses a fine-grained GitHub token to provide read-only access to its contents.

#### 3\. Set Up the Virtual Environment

Navigate into the cloned repository's root directory and run `uv sync --group dev`. This will create a virtual environment (`.venv` folder) and install all the necessary packages defined in the `pyproject.toml` file.

```bash
cd course-ai-agents
uv sync --group dev
```

#### 4\. Configure Your API Key

The course notebooks use Google's Gemini models. To use them, you'll need to get a free API key from Google AI Studio.

1.  Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
2.  Open the new `.env` file and replace the placeholder text with your actual `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

#### 5. Launch Jupyter Notebooks

The code exercises are in the form of Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files). You can run them using the classic browser interface or a modern code editor like VS Code.

**Option A: Run in your Web Browser**

1.  First, create a Jupyter kernel that points to your new virtual environment:
    ```bash
    uv run ipython kernel install --user --name="ai-agents-course"
    ```
2.  Launch the Jupyter Notebook interface:
    ```bash
    uv run jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  This will open a new tab in your browser. Navigate to a lesson's notebook file.
4.  Once the notebook is open, click on **Kernel > Change kernel** in the top menu and select `"ai-agents-course"` from the list.

**Option B: Run in VS Code**

1.  Make sure you have the official [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) installed from the marketplace.
2.  Open the `course-ai-agents` project folder in VS Code.
3.  Open any `notebook.ipynb` file from the `lessons` directory.
4.  Click on the **“Select Kernel”** button in the top-right of the editor.
5.  Choose **“Python Environments”** from the list of options.
6.  Select the virtual environment from the cloned repository, which will be located at `.venv/bin/python`.

You are now ready to run the code cells in the notebook
