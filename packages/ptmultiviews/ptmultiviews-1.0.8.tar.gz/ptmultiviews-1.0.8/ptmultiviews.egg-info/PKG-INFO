## PTMULTIVIEWS - Apache Multiviews Detection & Enumeration Tool

## Installation
```
pip install ptmultiviews
```

## Adding to PATH
If you're unable to invoke the script from your terminal, it's likely because it's not included in your PATH. You can resolve this issue by executing the following commands, depending on the shell you're using:

For Bash Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For ZSH Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage examples

```
ptmultiviews -u https://www.example.com/                          # Test single URL for MultiViews vulnerability and retrieve alternatives
ptmultiviews -u https://www.example.com/ -co                      # Test single URL for MultiViews vulnerability without enumeration
ptmultiviews -u https://www.example.com/index.php -o output.txt   # Saves enumerated files to output.txt
ptmultiviews -f urlList.txt                                       # Enumerate all files from urlList
