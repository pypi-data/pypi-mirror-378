\# Custom\_Encoder



This is a Python package extending PyTorchâ€™s `nn.Module`, designed to allow deep learning training models to quickly change encoders without modifying the overall model architecture. It aims to improve code reusability and flexibility by enabling seamless integration of any encoder model.



\## Features

\-  Easily change encoders in existing models without changing architecture

&nbsp;   

\-   Enhance code reusability and modularity

&nbsp;   

\-   Compatible with arbitrary encoder models for flexible use
