## Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme

A HATS catalog is a partitioning of objects on a sphere. Its purpose is for 
storing data from large astronomy surveys, but could probably be used for other 
use cases where you have large data with some spherical properties.

Check out our [ReadTheDocs site](https://hats.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
for more information on partitioning, installation, and contributing.
