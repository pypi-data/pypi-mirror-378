    ðŸ“¦ AI MODEL VERSION - The Trained Artifact
    
    CORE CONCEPT:
    This represents a specific, trained version of an AI model that is ready for deployment.
    It's the successful result of a training run, packaged and versioned for production use.
    
    KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
    â€¢ ONE training run â†’ ZERO or ONE model version (if training succeeded)
    â€¢ ONE training configuration â†’ MULTIPLE model versions (over time) 
    â€¢ ONE model specification â†’ MULTIPLE model versions (across all training configs)
    
    VERSION LINEAGE:
    Model versions form lineages based on their training configuration:
    â€¢ Daily retrain config: v1.0.1, v1.0.2, v1.0.3... (daily versions)
    â€¢ Weekly retrain config: v1.1.0, v1.2.0, v1.3.0... (weekly versions)
    â€¢ Different configs can have different versioning schemes
    
    EXTERNAL MODEL VERSIONS:
    For external models (GPT, Gemini), versions track:
    â€¢ API endpoint configurations and authentication
    â€¢ Structured output schemas and inference parameters
    â€¢ Cost tracking and performance monitoring
    â€¢ Fallback strategies and reliability metrics
    
    LIFECYCLE STAGES:
    DRAFT â†’ TRAINING â†’ TRAINED â†’ VALIDATED â†’ DEPLOYED â†’ SERVING â†’ RETIRED
    
    PERFORMANCE TRACKING:
    Each version tracks its real-world performance to enable:
    â€¢ A/B testing between different training frequencies
    â€¢ Performance degradation detection
    â€¢ ROI analysis of different training strategies
    â€¢ Cost optimization for external model usage
