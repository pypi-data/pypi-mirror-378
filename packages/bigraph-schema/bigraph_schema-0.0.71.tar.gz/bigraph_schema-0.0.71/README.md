Welcome to `bigraph-schema` â€“ a library providing a serializable type schema for composite systems simulations. 
This library provides the core of the broader Vivarium 2.0 project.

The goal of `bigraph-schema` is to support interoperability and extensibility across composite simulation formats, 
facilitating integration with existing and future modeling platforms. This is achieved by establishing a 
standardized and serializable schema for the complex, hierarchical, and multiscale nature of biological systems.
