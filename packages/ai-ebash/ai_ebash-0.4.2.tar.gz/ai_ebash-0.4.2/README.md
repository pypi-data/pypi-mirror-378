# Ai-ebash!

Console utility for integrating artificial intelligence into a Linux terminal. Allows you to ask an AI question and execute the scripts and commands suggested by the AI in the terminal. It will be useful for novice Linux administrators.

The project is in the pre-alpha stage. In case of problems with the installation or operation of the Ai-bash utility, please contact me.

## Features

- Sends requests to LLM from the command line with a simple command and receives responses in a formatted, easy-to-read form
- Supports dialog mode (key -d). By default, the quick questions mode with a return to the console works without a key.
- In the dialog mode, it allows you to run scripts proposed by the neural network (be careful!)
