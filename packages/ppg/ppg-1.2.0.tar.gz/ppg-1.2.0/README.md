PPG is a modern and powerful framework for building scalable desktop applications with Python and Qt. It offers a component-based architecture inspired by **React**, an advanced global state management system (**Pydux**), and seamless support for **hybrid interfaces** that combine native widgets with modern web UIs. With a comprehensive CLI and an innovative **hot-reloading engine**, PPG provides a complete and efficient workflow for developers.

### üî• Key Features

* **Reactive Component Architecture**: Design your UI using a component-based React-style approach that guides each element through a lifecycle of initialization, rendering, and cleanup.
* **Global State Management (Pydux)**: A robust, type-safe system (powered by Pydantic) for real-time communication between your components.
* **Hybrid Support**: Seamlessly combine native Qt widgets with modern web UIs (React, Vue, etc.) within the same application.
* **Hot Reloading Engine**: Boost your productivity with instant code reloads that let you see UI changes without restarting the app.
* **Comprehensive CLI**: A command-line interface that automates your entire app lifecycle, from initialization to compilation and installer creation.

### üöÄ Quick Start

The PPG workflow is simple and intuitive. Here‚Äôs how you can initialize, run, and compile your first application:

```bash
# 1. Install PPG using pip
pip install ppg

# 2. Initialize a new project with the CLI
ppg init

# 3. Run your application in development mode
ppg start

# 4. Compile your app into a standalone executable
ppg freeze

# 5. Create an installer for your application
ppg installer
```

### Installation
For best practices, we recommend using a virtual environment.

1. **Create and activate your virtual environment**:
```bash
# With conda
conda create -n my-env python=3.11 -y
conda activate my-env

# With virtualenv
python -m venv venv

# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

2. **Install PPG**:
```bash
pip install ppg
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version directly from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/neuri-ai/PPG.git
```

Or clone the repository and install it locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuri-ai/PPG

cd PPG

python setup.py install
```

### CLI Usage

The PPG CLI allows you to manage your project efficiently.

| Command        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ppg init`     | Initializes a new project in the current directory with an interactive setup. |
| `ppg start`    | Runs your application from the source code in development mode.             |
| `ppg create`   | Creates a new component or view from templates, *maintaining* your project's structure. |
| `ppg freeze`   | Compiles your code into a standalone executable for distribution.           |
| `ppg installer`| Creates a user-friendly installer for your app (e.g., `.exe` on Windows, `.dmg` on macOS). |
| `ppg test`     | Automatically runs the unit tests for your project.                         |
| `ppg clean`    | Cleans up temporary and build files generated by PPG.                       |

### Component Architecture

Traditional Qt is event-driven, but it lacks a structured lifecycle for managing UI components at a high level. This can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain code as applications grow.

PPG solves this with a well-defined, React-inspired component lifecycle. It provides clear hooks for every stage of a component's life, from creation to destruction. This allows you to write clean, predictable code by providing specific moments to:

- **Mounting**: Set up a component and fetch initial data.
- **Updating**: React to data changes and re-render the UI.
- **Unmounting**: Clean up resources to prevent memory leaks.

This architecture brings a modern and robust development experience to both native Qt widgets and hybrid web components.

### State Management with Pydux

Pydux is PPG's global state management system, inspired by JavaScript's Redux.
It provides a type-safe, reactive way to manage application state across components. Pydux uses Pydantic for data validation and serialization, ensuring that your state is always consistent and reliable.

- **Unified State**: Maintains a single global state that is shared across all your components.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that your state is always valid and adheres to defined schemas.
- **Replaces PPGStore**: `PPGStore` has been deprecated. It is highly recommended to migrate to Pydux to leverage all of its features.

### Hybrid Development (Web + Native)
PPG supports hybrid development, allowing you to combine native Qt widgets with modern web UIs (like React or Vue) in the same application. This enables you to:
- **Hybrid Interfaces**: Use native widgets for performance-critical parts of your app.
- **Fluid Communication**: `WebEngineBridge` and `BridgeManager` provide a bidirectional messaging channel, allowing your web frontend and Python backend to communicate transparently.
- **Total Synchronization**: Both native widgets and web components can use the same Pydux state management system, ensuring a consistent and reactive user experience.
