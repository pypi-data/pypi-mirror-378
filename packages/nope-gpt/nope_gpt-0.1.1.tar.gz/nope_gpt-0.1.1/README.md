# NoPE GPT

NoPE GPT is a generative pretrained Transformer-style (GPT) language model with no positional embeddings (NoPE). Built using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and trained on HuggingFace's [Fineweb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb), [SmolTalk](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/smoltalk), and [UltraFeedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/ultrafeedback_binarized) datasets, NoPE GPT can answer questions, summarize documents, use tools, and more.

## Features

- **No positional embeddings (NoPE)**: NoPE GPT aims to be a more parsimonious model by completely removing positional embeddings from the architecture allowing the context length to vary without complex model surgery. Despite having no positional embeddings, NoPE GPT performs better at context length generalization than the best relative embeddings (ALiBi, RoPE, T5) offering good performance even when operating within 2X the trained context window.

- **Fast and memory-efficient**: NoPE GPT employs a number of training and inference-time optimizations such as KV-caching, Group Query Attention, activation checkpointing, and Fully-sharded Data Parallel pretraining. As such, you can train and infer using relatively modest hardware.

- **Fully Open-source**: Unlike closed-source LLMs, NoPE GPT provides both the model weights *and* the source code to train, fine-tune, export, and generate text from the model using your own hardware.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [NoPE-GPT-400M-Chat](https://huggingface.co/andrewdalpino/NoPE-GPT-400M-Chat) | 50,261 | 1280 | 20 | 5 | 4X | 20 | 408M |

## Installation

The code required to run inference comes as a Python package that you can install with your favorite package manager such as [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

```sh
pip install nope-gpt
```

## Pretrained Examples

This first example we'll show how to load a pretrained base model from HuggingFace Hub and then use it to generate text. First, make sure the `nope-gpt` package is installed into your project. Once the package is installed you can load pretrained weights from HuggingFace Hub like in the example below.

```python
from nope_gpt.model import NoPEGPT
from nope_gpt.tokenization import ChatTokenizer

model_name = "andrewdalpino/NoPE-GPT-400M-Base"

model = NoPEGPT.from_pretrained(model_name)

tokenizer = ChatTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

Then, to generate text, provide a prompt, tokenize it, and iterate through the `generate()` method until the model outputs a stop token.

```python
import torch

prompt = input("Enter a prompt: ")

prompt = tokenizer.tokenize(prompt)

prompt = torch.tensor(prompt, dtype=torch.int64)

for token, probability in model.generate(prompt):
    if token.item() in tokenizer.stop_tokens:
        break

    out = tokenizer.decode_single_token(token)

    print(out, end="", flush=True)
```

Generating text from the base model is the simplest way to get started with model inference, however, it is not the most useful when it comes to being able to chat with and guide the model output. In this example we'll load one of the pretrained chat models from HuggingFace Hub and then chat with it. In addition, we'll make use of short-term memory so the model can remember the chat history.

First, load a pretrained chat model from HuggingFace Hub like in the example below.

```python
from nope_gpt.model import NoPEGPT
from nope_gpt.tokenization import ChatTokenizer

model_name = "andrewdalpino/NoPE-GPT-400M-Chat"

model = NoPEGPT.from_pretrained(model_name)

tokenizer = ChatTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

Then, we'll define a partial function that will generate tokens with a set of default parameters such as `max_tokens`, `context_length`, and `temperature`.

```python
from functools import partial

generate = partial(
    model.generate,
    max_tokens=2000,
    context_length=8192,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_k=500
    top_p=0.9,
    repeat_penalty=0.1,
    repeat_window=50,
)
```

Next, we'll instantiate a `BufferWindowMemory` object to handle the chat history and craft a system message that will guide generation. Note that messages are inputted as dicts with `role` and `content` keys. For a system message use the `system` role.

```python
from nope_gpt.memory import BufferWindowMemory

memory = BufferWindowMemory(4)

system_message = {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are a friendly AI assistant.",
}
```

Finally, prompt the user for input, adds the system message and chat history to the context, tokenizes the messages, and then generates the `assistant` response.

```python
import torch

while True:
    prompt = input("Enter a prompt: ")

    user_message = {
        "role": "user",
        "content": prompt,
    }

    memory.add_message(user_message)

    messages = [system_message] + memory.get_history()

    tokens = tokenizer.tokenize_prompt(messages)

    prompt = torch.tensor(tokens, dtype=torch.int64, device=args.device)

    response = ""

    for token, probability in generate(prompt):
        if token.item() in tokenizer.stop_tokens:
            break

        out = tokenizer.decode_single_token(token)

        print(out, end="", flush=True)

        response += out

    print("\n")

    assistant_message = {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": response,
    }

    memory.add_message(assistant_message)
```

You're done! For more advanced usages take a look at the `generate.py` and `chat.py` scripts located in the code repository.

## Training and Fine-tuning

In addition to the inference code, we also provide training and fine-tuning code so you can build your own NoPE GPT models. Before getting started, take a look at the `model_sizing.ipynb` IPython notebook in the project repo for a guide to sizing your model based on the amount of memory and compute you have available.

### Clone the project repo

We'll need the code from the project repository to train and/or fine-tune the model.

```
git clone https://andrewdalpino/NoPE-GPT
```

### Install Project Dependencies

Project dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) using the following command from the project root. We recommend using a virtual environment such as `venv` to keep package dependencies on your system tidy.

```
python -m venv ./.venv

source ./.venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Pretraining

Pretraining focuses on building a foundation of language and general knowledge to use as a base for future supervised fine-tuning. The training objective is to predict the next token in a sample of text. It is a self-supervised form of training because the model learns from masked inputs of unsupervised data. For the pretraining corpus we use the Fineweb dataset which consists of 15T high-quality tokens gathered from the worldwide web. In addition, the dataset has been split into 3 subsets (10BT, 100BT, and 350BT versions) for training smaller models.

```
python pretrain.py
```

**Note** that it will take a while to download and pre-process the dataset the first time that the training script is run.

To customize the default architecture you can adjust the `embedding_dimensions`, attention heads, `num_hidden_layers`, and `feed_forward_ratio` arguments of the pretraining script. 

```
python pretrain.py --embedding_dimensions=4096 --num_q_heads=64 --num_kv_heads=16 --num_hidden_layers=48 --feed_forward_ratio=4
```

You can also adjust the `batch_size`, `learning_rate`, and `gradient_accumulation_steps` to suite your training setup.

```
python pretrain.py --batch_size=32 --learning_rate=0.01 --gradient_accumulation_steps=128
```

If you are planning a long training run, it is recommended to set a random seed. This will ensure that any random state is preserved if the process gets interrupted.

```
python pretrain.py --seed=42
```

For distributed training, use PyTorch's [torchrun](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html) extension to launch a distributed data parallel (DDP) session. The example below is for executing the training script on a single node with 8 individual GPUs.

```
torchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc-per-node=8 pretrain.py --batch_size=16 --gradient_accumulation_steps=128
```

**Note** that when training in data-parallel mode it's important that the `gradient_accumulation_steps` divides evenly into the world size for maximum performance. For example, if we have an 8 GPU cluster, we could perform 32 gradient accumulation steps in exactly 4 passes over the network.

### Fine-tuning

Instruction-tuning is a supervised training technique focused on developing specialized objectives such as chatting, text summarization, chain-of-thought, and prompt rewriting. We use the SmolTalk and UltraFeedback datasets by HuggingFace as fine-tuning corpora because they include a broad range of training objectives such as conversation, instruction following, summarization, and human preference alignment.

```
python instruction-tune.py
```

To pick which dataset subsets to train on you can specify them in a comma-separated list like in the example below.

```
python instruction-tune.py --dataset_subsets=smol-magpie-ultra,smol-summarize,ultra-feedback
```

You can also adjust the `batch_size`, `learning_rate`, and `gradient_accumulation_steps` just like we did with pre-training.

```
python instruction-tune.py --batch_size=32 --learning_rate=0.01 --gradient_accumulation_steps=32
```

To adjust the number of trainable LoRA parameters as well as the strength of the LoRA and Dropout signals you can change the `--rank`, `--alpha`, and `--dropout` arguments respectively.

```
python instruction-tune.py --rank=4 --alpha=0.8 --dropout=0.1
```
