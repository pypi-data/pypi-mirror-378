### Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Owners and responsibilities assigned for each component
- [ ] Dependencies and failure handling identified
- [ ] Migration/backwards-compat plan defined (or marked N/A)
- [ ] Telemetry, alerting, and runbook updates specified
- [ ] Security controls tied to identified threats
- [ ] Testing and rollout plan documented
- [ ] Spec gaps resolved or tracked with owners

Gate: FAIL (initialize as FAIL until the checklist is complete)
