# Active Development Artifacts

This directory holds the live working copies for the current SDD cycle.

Getting started:
1. Copy the relevant templates from `.spec-dev/templates/`.
2. Rename them to the canonical filenames (`active-spec.md`, `active-plan.md`, etc.).
3. Populate each file according to the instructions in `.spec-dev/*.md`.
4. Delete this README once real artifacts are in place.

The directory should only contain the files that reflect the current state of the
Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement loop.
