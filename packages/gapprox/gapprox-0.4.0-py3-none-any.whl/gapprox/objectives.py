# error is pretty hard to find, because gapprox currently does it using discretely and numerically. and even then, it can do it by either taking in a bunch of points or taking a callable and sampling it on the spot. and gapprox should also be able to find error symbolically, continuously, analytically.

# at least im sure about one thing: error should not sample the callable inside it. it should take sampled points. because when error is evaluated for each iteration, it should not have to resample for every iteration.
