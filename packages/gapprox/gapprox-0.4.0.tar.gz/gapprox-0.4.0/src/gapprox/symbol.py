# for example, in something like ex² + 3.5:
# e is a constant, with a name and a value
# x is a variable, with only a name
# ² and 3.5 are parameters, with only values
# they are all symbols. so thats why i subclass them like this

# strictly speaking, the DAG should not specialize for these things, like specializing InputNode to have different substitution behaviour depending on if payload is a Symbol, or which subclass of Symbol, etc

# like most other symbolic systems like sympy, tensorflow, mathematica, etc, gapprox considers Variable to be name first, Parameter to be value first, and Constant to be name first
# a Variable is never assigned a value, but can be assigned one after instantiation
# a Parameter is a value first and foremost, but also optionally has a name
# a Constant makes sense with just a name, even without a value

# something like 3xᵉ + pxᵖ + sin(πy) where p = 2 will look like:
# var1 = Variable('x')
# var2 = Variable('y')
# param1 = Parameter(3)
# param1 = Parameter(2, name='p')
# const1 = Constant('π', value=math.pi)
# const2 = Constant('e', value=math.e)
# param1*var1**const2 + param1*var1**param1 + sin(const1*var2)
# (technically, you should use const1=gapprox.constants.e and const2=gapprox.constants.pi, which are specially supported for algebraic manipulation like simplification)

# ALL attributes of Variable, Parameter, Constant are mutable. changing the name of a Constant does not affect its identity in the expression, because in gapprox, an expression is stored in a Dag, and a Dag only cares about object id, not the name
