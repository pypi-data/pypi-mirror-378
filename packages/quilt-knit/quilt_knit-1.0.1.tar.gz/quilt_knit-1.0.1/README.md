## Overview

Quilt enables you to combine individual knitted swatches into larger, more complex structures through:

- **Course-wise merging** (horizontal combination)
- **Wale-wise merging** (vertical combination)
- **Quilt construction** (complex grid patterns)

Mix and match different stitch patterns including jersey, rib, seed, lace, cable, and jacquard.

from quilt_knit.swatch.course_wise_merging.Course_Merge_Process import Course_Merge_Process

# Create and merge two swatches horizontally
left_swatch = Swatch("left", "left_program.k")
right_swatch = Swatch("right", "right_program.k")

connection = Course_Wise_Connection(left_swatch, right_swatch)
