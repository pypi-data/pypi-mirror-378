# Contributing
## PR Process
1. Explain the problem your are trying to solve/the feature your are adding
    - Your commit history should be clean and explanatory
    - Avoid large bulk commits, separate them by intent and effect
1. Remember to update documentation if required
    - Update stub files `*.pyi` when changing parts of the Rust code
    - Run `pytest` and `cargo teest` to ensure compatibility across the package
    - Suggest version bumping depending on the changes made. (See semver.org).
2. Do not include any large amounts of data files
    - instead write scripts to automatically obtain them (most likely download)
    - See `data/..` directories for examples
