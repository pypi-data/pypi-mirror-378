# Refactoroscope v0.2.0 - CI/CD Integration Release

## Summary

In this release, we've implemented comprehensive CI/CD integration support for Refactoroscope, making it easy to integrate code analysis into your automated workflows. This addresses one of the key planned features from our Product Requirement Document.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Support
- **Enhanced CI Workflow**: Extended the existing CI workflow with additional jobs for code quality checks, security audits, integration testing, and performance benchmarking
- **Dedicated Analysis Workflow**: Created a new `refactoroscope.yml` workflow specifically for running code analysis in CI/CD pipelines
- **Reusable GitHub Action**: Created an `action.yml` file that allows users to directly use Refactoroscope as a GitHub Action
- **Docker Support**: Added a Dockerfile for the GitHub Action to ensure consistent execution environments

### 2. GitLab CI Support
- **Complete GitLab CI Configuration**: Created a comprehensive `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with jobs for testing, code analysis, security auditing, and deployment
- **Pre-configured Stages**: Set up stages for test, analyze, and deploy with appropriate artifacts and caching

### 3. Documentation
- **CI/CD Integration Guide**: Created detailed documentation explaining how to integrate Refactoroscope into both GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD pipelines
- **README Updates**: Added CI/CD badges and integration instructions to the main README
- **Examples**: Provided practical examples for both GitHub Actions and GitLab CI integrations

### 4. Testing
- **Integration Tests**: Created integration tests to verify that the CLI works correctly in CI environments
- **Benchmark Tests**: Added performance benchmark tests to monitor analysis performance over time

### 5. Version Updates
- **Updated to v0.2.0**: Updated version numbers in `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`
- **CHANGELOG**: Documented all changes in the CHANGELOG.md file
- **PRD Updates**: Updated the Product Requirement Document to reflect the completed implementation

## How to Use

### GitHub Actions

To use Refactoroscope in your GitHub Actions workflow, you can either:

1. Use the direct action:
```yaml
- name: Run Code Analysis
  uses: moinsen-dev/refactoroscope@v0.2.0
  with:
    args: analyze . --complexity --export json,html
```

2. Install and run manually:
```yaml
- name: Install refactoroscope
  run: |
    uv pip install refactoroscope

- name: Run analysis
  run: |
    refactoroscope analyze . --complexity --export json,html --export-dir ./reports
```

### GitLab CI

For GitLab CI, add this to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
analyze:
  stage: analyze
  script:
    - pip install refactoroscope
    - refactoroscope analyze . --complexity --export json,html --export-dir ./reports
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - reports/
```

## Benefits

1. **Automated Code Analysis**: Automatically run code analysis on every push or pull request
2. **Quality Gates**: Configure your CI/CD pipeline to fail builds based on analysis results
3. **Historical Tracking**: Archive analysis reports as artifacts for trend analysis
4. **Multi-Platform Support**: Support for both GitHub Actions and GitLab CI
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in benchmarking to track analysis performance over time

## Next Steps

With CI/CD integration now complete, we're moving closer to our v1.0 release. Future enhancements will focus on:
- Web dashboard for visualizing analysis results
- IDE plugins for real-time feedback
- Advanced duplicate code detection
- AI-powered code quality suggestions
