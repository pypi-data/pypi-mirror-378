# Refactoroscope v0.4.1 - Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements

## Summary

This release focuses on bug fixes and stability improvements for the advanced refactoring tools introduced in v0.4.0. We've addressed several critical issues with AI provider implementations and CLI initialization that were causing runtime errors.

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. AI Provider Implementation Fixes
- **Missing Abstract Method Implementations**: Fixed missing `analyze` method implementations in all AI provider classes (Qwen, Anthropic, Google, Ollama)
- **Ollama Provider**: Fixed the Ollama provider to use requests directly instead of relying on an undefined client attribute
- **Anthropic Provider**: Improved handling of different content block types in API responses to prevent runtime errors
- **Type Checking**: Resolved type checking issues with AI provider factory registration

### 2. CLI Initialization Fix
- **Duplicate App Initialization**: Removed duplicate app initialization in CLI that was causing startup issues

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- **Duplicate Method Definition**: Fixed duplicate method definition in AI analyzer class that was causing runtime errors
- **Code Consistency**: Applied consistent code formatting and import organization across all AI provider files

## How to Upgrade

To upgrade to v0.4.1, simply update your installation:

```bash
pip install --upgrade refactoroscope
```

Or if using uv:

```bash
uv tool upgrade refactoroscope
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Stability**: Resolved critical runtime errors that were preventing proper execution of AI-powered features
2. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling in AI provider implementations for more robust operation
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Fixed inconsistencies in how different AI providers handle API responses
4. **Reliable Startup**: Eliminated CLI initialization issues for smooth operation

## Compatibility

This release maintains full backward compatibility with v0.4.0. All existing configurations and workflows will continue to work without any changes required.

## Next Steps

With these stability improvements in place, we're continuing our journey toward v1.0. Future enhancements will focus on:
- Web dashboard for visualizing analysis results
- IDE plugins for real-time feedback
- Performance optimizations for large codebases
- Enhanced AI-powered refactoring suggestions
