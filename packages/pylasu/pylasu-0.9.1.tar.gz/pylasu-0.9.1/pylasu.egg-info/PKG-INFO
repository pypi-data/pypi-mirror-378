Pylasu is an AST Library in the [StarLasu](https://github.com/Strumenta/StarLasu) family, targeting the Python language. [Documentation](https://pylasu.readthedocs.io) is on Read the Docs.

## Linting

```shell
flake8 . && flake8 tests
```

## Testing

```shell
pytest tests
```

## Packaging and Distribution (Releasing a New Version of Pylasu)

Update version in `pylasu/__init__.py`, commit, push and check that CI completes normally. 

Let's ensure that we have build and twine installed:

```shell
pip install build twine
```

Then, check the project can be released by linting and running the test suite:

```shell
flake8 . && flake8 tests --config tests/.flake8  
pytest tests
```

Finally, we can run:

```shell
rm -f dist/*
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

**Note:** if we have [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://pypi.org/help/#twofa) enabled on PyPI, 
we have to [use an API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken).

If all goes well, tag the release:

```shell
git tag -a v0.7.3 -m "Version 0.7.3"
git push origin v0.7.3
```

### Extracting Documentation

Here's how to extract the documentation into HTML using Sphinx, the most popular documentation generator for Python.

First, ensure you have Sphinx and the chosen theme installed:
```shell
pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
```

Then, extract the documentation from the source code:
```shell
sphinx-apidoc -o docs pylasu
```

Finally, change into the docs directory and launch the build process:
```shell
cd docs
make html
```

If everything goes as it should, in `docs/_build/html` you'll find the generated documentation.

We also host the documentation on ReadTheDocs. The project is [pylasu](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pylasu/). 
Documentation needs to be [built manually](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pylasu/) for each release for it to appear
online on https://pylasu.readthedocs.io.
