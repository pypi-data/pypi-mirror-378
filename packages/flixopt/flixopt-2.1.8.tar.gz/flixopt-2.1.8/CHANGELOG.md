## [2.1.8] - 2025-09-22
This release focuses on code quality improvements, enhanced documentation, and bug fixes for heat pump components and visualization features.

### Added
- Extra Check for HeatPumpWithSource.COP to be strictly > 1 to avoid division by zero
- Apply deterministic color assignment by using sorted() in `plotting.py`
- Add missing args in docstrings in `plotting.py`, `solvers.py`, and `core.py`.

### Changed
- Greatly improved docstrings and documentation of all public classes
- Make path handling to be gentle about missing .html suffix in `plotting.py`
- Default for `relative_losses` in `Transmission` is now 0 instead of None
- Setter of COP in `HeatPumpWithSource` now completely overwrites the conversion factors, which is safer.
- Fix some docstrings in plotting.py
- Change assertions to raise Exceptions in `plotting.py`

### Fixed
- Fix color scheme selection in network_app; color pickers now update when a scheme is selected.
- Fix error handling in network visualization if networkx is not installed.
- Fix broken links in docs.
- Fix COP getter and setter of `HeatPumpWithSource` returning and setting wrong conversion factors.
- Fix custom compression levels in `io.save_dataset_to_netcdf`
- Fix `total_max` did not work when total min was not used.

### *Development*
- Pin dev dependencies to specific versions
- Improve CI workflows to run faster and smarter

- lint and format in CI
- improved CI
- Updated Dependencies
- Updated Issue Templates


## [2.1.6] - 2025-09-02

### Changed
- `Sink`, `Source` and `SourceAndSink` now accept multiple `flows` as `inputs` and `outputs` instead of just one. This enables to model more use cases using these classes. [[#291](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixopt/pull/291) by [@FBumann](https://github.com/FBumann)]
- Further, both `Sink` and `Source` now have a `prevent_simultaneous_flow_rates` argument to prevent simultaneous flow rates of more than one of their Flows. [[#291](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixopt/pull/291) by [@FBumann](https://github.com/FBumann)]

### Added
- Added `FlowSystem.start_network_app()` and `FlowSystem.stop_network_app()` to easily visualize the network structure of a flow system in an interactive dash web app. This is still experimental and might change in the future. [[#293](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixopt/pull/293) by [@FBumann](https://github.com/FBumann)]

### Deprecated
- For the classes `Sink`, `Source` and `SourceAndSink`: `.sink`, `.source` and `.prevent_simultaneous_sink_and_source` are deprecated in favor of the new arguments `inputs`, `outputs` and `prevent_simultaneous_flow_rates`. [[#291](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixopt/pull/291) by [@FBumann](https://github.com/FBumann)]

### Fixed
- Fixed testing issue with new `linopy` version 0.5.6 [[#296](https://github.com/flixOpt/flixopt/pull/296) by [@FBumann](https://github.com/FBumann)]

## [2.1.5] - 2025-07-08

### Fixed
- Fixed Docs deployment

## [2.1.4] - 2025-07-08

### Fixed
- Fixing release notes of 2.1.3, as well as documentation build.


## [2.1.3] - 2025-07-08

### Fixed
- Using `Effect.maximum_operation_per_hour` raised an error, needing an extra timestep. This has been fixed thanks to @PRse4.

## [2.1.2] - 2025-06-14

### Fixed
- Storage losses per hour where not calculated correctly, as mentioned by @brokenwings01. This might have lead to issues with modeling large losses and long timesteps.
  - Old implementation:     $c(\text{t}_{i}) \cdot (1-\dot{\text{c}}_\text{rel,loss}(\text{t}_i)) \cdot \Delta \text{t}_{i}$
  - Correct implementation: $c(\text{t}_{i}) \cdot (1-\dot{\text{c}}_\text{rel,loss}(\text{t}_i)) ^{\Delta \text{t}_{i}}$

### Known issues
- Just to mention: Plotly >= 6 may raise errors if "nbformat" is not installed. We pinned plotly to <6, but this may be fixed in the future.

## [2.1.1] - 2025-05-08

### Fixed
- Fixed bug in the `_ElementResults.constraints` not returning the constraints but rather the variables

### Changed
- Improved docstring and tests

## [2.1.0] - 2025-04-11

### Added
- Python 3.13 support added
- Logger warning if relative_minimum is used without on_off_parameters in Flow
- Greatly improved internal testing infrastructure by leveraging linopy's testing framework

### Fixed
- Fixed the lower bound of `flow_rate` when using optional investments without OnOffParameters
- Fixed bug that prevented divest effects from working
- Added lower bounds of 0 to two unbounded vars (numerical improvement)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Restructured the modeling of the On/Off state of Flows or Components
  - Variable renaming: `...|consecutive_on_hours` → `...|ConsecutiveOn|hours`
  - Variable renaming: `...|consecutive_off_hours` → `...|ConsecutiveOff|hours`
  - Constraint renaming: `...|consecutive_on_hours_con1` → `...|ConsecutiveOn|con1`
  - Similar pattern for all consecutive on/off constraints

## [2.0.1] - 2025-04-10

### Added
- Logger warning if relative_minimum is used without on_off_parameters in Flow

### Fixed
- Replace "|" with "__" in filenames when saving figures (Windows compatibility)
- Fixed bug that prevented the load factor from working without InvestmentParameters

## [2.0.0] - 2025-03-29

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Complete migration from Pyomo to Linopy optimization framework
- **BREAKING**: Redesigned data handling to rely on xarray.Dataset throughout the package
- **BREAKING**: Framework renamed from flixOpt to flixopt (`import flixopt as fx`)
- **BREAKING**: Results handling completely redesigned with new `CalculationResults` class

### Added
- Full model serialization support - save and restore unsolved Models
- Enhanced model documentation with YAML export containing human-readable mathematical formulations
- Extend flixopt models with native linopy language support
- Full Model Export/Import capabilities via linopy.Model
- Unified solution exploration through `Calculation.results` attribute
- Compression support for result files
- `to_netcdf/from_netcdf` methods for FlowSystem and core components
- xarray integration for TimeSeries with improved datatypes support
- Google Style Docstrings throughout the codebase

### Fixed
- Improved infeasible model detection and reporting
- Enhanced time series management and serialization
- Reduced file size through improved compression

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Pyomo dependency (replaced by linopy)
- Period concepts in time management (simplified to timesteps)
