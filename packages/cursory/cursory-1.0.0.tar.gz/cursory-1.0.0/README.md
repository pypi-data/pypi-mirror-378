#### Cursory - Mouse Trajectory Factory. Generate 100% human-realistic Mouse Trajectories with Timings.

---

## Install it from PyPI

```bash
pip install cursory
```

---

## Basic Usage

```py
from cursory import generate_trajectory

trajectory: list[tuple[float, float]]
timings: list[int]
trajectory, timings = generate_trajectory(target_start=..., target_end=...)
```

---

## Methodology

Cursory generates Mouse Trajectories following these steps:
1. **Find a close matching human Trajectory**: Cursory has a database of thousands of Mouse Trajectories recorded from real humans. It finds the closest matching Trajectory to the target Points with some amount of randomization.
2. **Morph the Trajectory**: The Trajectory is morphed to fit the target Points exactly, while keeping the overall shape and timings as close to the original as possible.
3. **Add Noise**: The Trajectory is jittered and knotted, to alter positions slightly to avoid fingerprinting by hash-fingerprinting.
4. **Regenerating with Timings**: The Trajectory is regenerated using the Trajectory Frequency, with some noise added to the timings to avoid.
5. **Re-Add Noise**: The Trajectory is jittered and knotted, to alter positions slightly to avoid fingerprinting by hash-fingerprinting.
6. **Morph the Trajectory**: The Trajectory is morphed to fit the target Points exactly, while keeping the overall shape and timings as close to the original as possible.

> [!WARNING]  
> Theoretically, it is possible to detect/fingerprint Mouse Trajectories generated by Cursory. But this would require an amount of compute power which is unfeasible. A greater risk of detection would be bad Trajectories, which is mitigated by the advanced algorithms used in Cursory.
