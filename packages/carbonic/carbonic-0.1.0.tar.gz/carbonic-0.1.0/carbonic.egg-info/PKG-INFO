# Carbonic

A modern Python datetime library inspired by PHP Carbon, built with stdlib `zoneinfo`, dataclasses for immutability, and comprehensive localization support.

Carbonic provides an intuitive and fluent API for working with dates and times in Python, leveraging modern Python features for better type safety and performance.

## Features

- 🚀 **Fluent and immutable API** - Built with dataclasses for type safety
- 🌍 **Stdlib zoneinfo** - Uses Python's built-in timezone support (no external dependencies)
- 🔒 **Immutable by design** - All operations return new instances
- 🌐 **Full i18n support** - English, Polish, and extensible locale system
- ⚡ **High performance** - Minimal overhead with stdlib components
- 🔧 **Comprehensive formatting** - Extensive date/time formatting options
- 📝 **Human-readable differences** - Localized relative time descriptions
- 🎯 **Type-safe** - Full type hints throughout

## Installation
```bash
pip install carbonic
