# Qmorse

**Qmorse** is a lightweight Python library for **encoding and decoding text to Binary Morse code**.  
It is simple, fast, and easy to integrate into any Python project.

Binary Morse code represents Morse symbols using binary digits (0s and 1s), making it useful for digital communications, simulations, and learning purposes.

## Features

- Encode text into binary Morse code.  
- Decode binary Morse code back into readable text.  
- Lightweight and dependency-free.  
- Easy-to-use API for beginners and advanced users.

---

## Installation

Install Qmorse using `pip`:

```bash
pip install Qmorse
