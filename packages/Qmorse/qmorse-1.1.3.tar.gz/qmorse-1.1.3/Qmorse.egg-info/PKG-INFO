# Qmorse

**Qmorse** is a lightweight and efficient Python library for **encoding and decoding text into Binary Morse code**. It provides a modern, easy-to-use interface for converting text to a binary representation of Morse code (`0`s and `1`s) and back. Qmorse is ideal for educational purposes, digital communication simulations, cryptography experiments, or just playing with Morse in Python.

Binary Morse code uses `0` for short signals (dots) and `1` for long signals (dashes), allowing seamless integration into digital systems and computer simulations.
Note that this library is made for real use of the morse code.

## Features

- **Text to Binary Morse:** Encode standard text (letters, numbers, and basic punctuation) into a binary Morse representation.
- **Binary Morse to Text:** Decode a binary Morse string back into human-readable text.
- **File Support:** Read/write binary Morse code to and from `.txt` files.
- **Step-by-Step Conversion:** Supports fine-grained encoding/decoding for custom applications.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple API designed for both beginners and advanced users.
- **Optional Audio Conversion:** Convert binary Morse sequences into listenable beeps (short/long tones) with customizable timing.

## Installation

Install Qmorse via PyPI:

```bash
pip install Qmorse
