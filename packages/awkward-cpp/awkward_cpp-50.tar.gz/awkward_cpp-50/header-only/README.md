# Awkward Header-only Libraries

This CMake project defined a set of header-only libraries for working with Awkward Array. Use of these libraries is
described in the [documentation](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/user-guide/). If you are not using CMake, then
ensure that the contents of `builder-options`, `growable-buffer`, `layout-builder` are on the include path.
