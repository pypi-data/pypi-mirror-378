# Integrating with Rails

This page explains how to integrate Terra with a Rails app.

:::tip
This is a community-maintained document. Please [ask the community](/resources/community) if you have questions about this integration. You can also [suggest improvements](https://github.com/nasa/terra-ui-components/blob/next/docs/tutorials/integrating-with-rails.md) to make it better.
:::

## Requirements

This integration has been tested with the following:

-   Rails >= 6
-   Node >= 12.10
-   Webpacker >= 5

## Instructions

To get started using Terra with Rails, the following packages must be installed.

```bash
yarn add @nasa-terra/components copy-webpack-plugin
```

### Importing the Default Theme

The next step is to import Terra's default theme (stylesheet) in `app/javascript/stylesheets/application.scss`.

```css
@import '@nasa-terra/components/dist/themes/light';
@import '@nasa-terra/components/dist/themes/dark'; // Optional dark theme
```

Fore more details about themes, please refer to [Theme Basics](/getting-started/themes#theme-basics).

### Importing Required Scripts

After importing the theme, you'll need to import the JavaScript files for Terra. Add the following code to `app/javascript/packs/application.js`.

```js
import '../stylesheets/application.scss'
import { setBasePath, SlAlert, SlAnimation, TerraButton, ... } from '@nasa-terra/components'

// ...

const rootUrl = document.currentScript.src.replace(/\/packs.*$/, '')

// Path to the assets folder (should be independent from the current script source path
// to work correctly in different environments)
setBasePath(rootUrl + '/packs/js/')
```

### webpack Config

Next we need to add Terra's assets to the final build output. To do this, modify `config/webpack/environment.js` to look like this.

```js
const { environment } = require('@rails/webpacker')

// Terra config
const path = require('path')
const CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin')

// Add terra assets to webpack's build process
environment.plugins.append(
    'CopyPlugin',
    new CopyPlugin({
        patterns: [
            {
                from: path.resolve(
                    __dirname,
                    '../../node_modules/@nasa-terra/components/dist/assets'
                ),
                to: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../public/packs/js/assets'),
            },
        ],
    })
)

module.exports = environment
```

### Adding Pack Tags

The final step is to add the corresponding `pack_tags` to the page. You should have the following `tags` in the `<head>` section of `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- ... -->

        <%= stylesheet_pack_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track':
        'reload' %> <%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track':
        'reload' %>
    </head>
    <body>
        <%= yield %>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now you can start using Terra components with Rails!
