    Class to combine multiple operations into a single operation.

    This class allows for the combination of multiple operations of the same type,
    which are executed sequentially and their results combined. Operations can be
    accessed by index, iterated over, and the class supports addition and
    multiplication operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    operations : list[OperationType]
        The operations to combine into a single operation. All operations must be
        of the same type specified by the OperationType generic parameter.

    Attributes
    ----------
    operations : list[OperationType]
        The list of operations to be executed.

    Returns

    Any
        The combined result of all operations, typically the sum of their individual results.
