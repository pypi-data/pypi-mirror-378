# solposx

**Sol**ar**Pos**ition**X** (`solposx`) is a Python package for determining solar position and atmospheric refraction. The package contains reference implementations of common solar position algorithms used for solar energy applications. Additionally, the package also features several algorithms for approximating atmospheric refraction in order to calculate the apparent position of the sun.

If you are new to this package, check out the introduction to [solar position algorithms](solarposition_introduction) and [refraction models](refraction_introduction). Alternatively, you may wish to dive straight into the [documentation](documentation), check out how to [install the solposx package](installation), or get updated on [recent developments](whatsnew).
