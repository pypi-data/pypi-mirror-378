gpio_manager

A comprehensive library for managing GPIO operations, including input/output control,
PWM management, I2C communication, and support for edge-triggered callbacks with debounce.
Suitable for all Raspberry Pi models.

Classes:

- GPIOManager: Manages GPIO pins, including input and output configurations, and supports callback assignments.

- PWMManager: Controls Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) functionality for GPIO pins.

- I2CManager: Provides I2C communication functions for interacting with I2C devices.

- Enums: Defines enums such as PinState, LogicLevel, InternPullResistorState, and TriggerEdge for easy configuration
of pin states and edge triggers.

Example usage:
    from gpio_manager import GPIOManager
    gpio = GPIOManager()
    gpio.add_input_pin(pin_num=4)
    gpio.assign_callback(pin_num=4, callback=my_callback)
