# Experimental data
The experimental data used to train EPI Suite models are available [here](https://episuite.dev/EpiWebSuite/#/help/associated-databases). We provide an interface to access the data directly within the package. Here's a quote from the EPI Suite website:
> The EPIUnified database holds the combined values from: PhysProp and the available EPI Suite™ model Training and Validation sets.  
The data sets available are:  
**WSKOWWIN**: WSKOWWIN Program Methodology & Validation Documents (includes Training & Validation datasets)  
**WaterFragmentDataFiles**: WATERNT (Water Solubility Fragment) Program Methodology & Validation Documents (includes Training & Validation datasets) BioHCwin - estimates biodegradation of hydrocarbons  
**MP-BP-VP-TestSets**: MPBPWIN (Melting Pt, Boiling Pt, Vapor Pressure) Program Test Sets  
**Data_for_BCFBAF**: BCFBAF Excel spreadsheets of BCF and kM data used in training & validation (includes the Jon Arnot Source BCF DB with multiple BCF values)  
**HENRYWIN_Data_EPI**: HENRYWIN Data files used in training & validation (includes Meylan and Howard (1991) Data document)

CAS		-	Chemical Abstract Service Registry number (the few numbers below 000050-00-0 are not real CAS numbers, but used to designate compounds with no CAS number or an unknown CAS number; these designated numbers can be retrieved from the SRC SMILECAS database).  

CLASS	-	An arbitrary classification of compounds by structure.  Many compounds overlap individual classes.  In general, compounds that are drugs or pesticides are assigned to those classes.  Anilines were given precedence over phenols which were given precedence over nitrobenzenes, etc.  The class numbers are as follows:  
                1.  Alkanes				24.  Haloalcohols, aliphatic
                2.  Haloalkanes				25.  Nitriles
                3.  Alkenes				26.  Misc Nitrogens

LOGP		-	measured log Kow value  
LOGMOLAR  -	logarithm of the measured water solubility in molar units  
ESTIMATE	-	water solubility estimate (in molar units) using equation 20  
ERROR		-	the difference between LOGMOLAR and ESTIMATE  
WSOL		-	the measured water solubility in units of mg/L  
MP			-	the melting point in oC;  "Liq" refers to liquids (MP < 25oC)  
MOLWT	-	the molecular weight of the compound
