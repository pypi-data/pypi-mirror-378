## Installation

**Install via pip:**

pip install vuln-checker
```

**Or from GitHub:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skm248/vuln-checker.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd vuln-checker
pip install .
```

## Usage
**Prerequisites:**
1.    Obtain an NVD API key from https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key and set it as an environment variable NVD_API_KEY or replace the placeholder in the script. Follow these steps to request a key:
      - Open your preferred web browser and navigate to https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key.
      - On the NVD - Request an API Key page, complete the following fields: 
2.	Organization Name: Enter the name of your organization.
3.	Email Address: Provide a valid business email address.
4.	Organization Type: Select the type that best represents your organization from the dropdown menu.
       - Carefully read and understand the NVD - Terms of Use section.
       - Scroll to the bottom of the Terms of Use and check the "I agree to the Terms of Use" checkbox to accept the agreement.
       - Click the submit button to send your request.
       - Check your email (including spam/junk folders) for a message from NVD containing a single-use activation hyperlink. This email is sent to the address provided.
        - Click the hyperlink within seven days to activate and view your API key. If not activated within this period, you must submit a new request.
        - Set the `NVD_API_KEY` environment variable using one of the following methods based on your operating system:

#### Windows (Command Prompt)
**Temporary (Current Session):**
1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Run the following command, replacing `your_actual_api_key` with your NVD API key:
   ```cmd
      set NVD_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   ```
   - Note: The variable is unset when the Command Prompt window is closed.

**Persistent (All Future Sessions):**
1. Open "System Properties":
2. Right-click 'This PC' ‚Üí 'Properties' ‚Üí 'Advanced system settings' ‚Üí 'Environment Variables'.
3. In the "User variables" or "System variables" section, click "New" or edit an existing NVD_API_KEY variable.
4. Set the Variable name to NVD_API_KEY and the Variable value to your_actual_api_key.
5. Click "OK" to save, then close all dialog boxes.
6. Open a new Command Prompt and verify with 
   ```cmd
      echo %NVD_API_KEY%
   ```
7. Run the script in the new session.

#### Windows (PowerShell)
**Temporary (Current Session):**
1. Open PowerShell.
2. Run the following command, replacing your_actual_api_key with your NVD API key: 
   ```cmd
      $env:NVD_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key"
   ```
3. Run the script in the same PowerShell session:
   ```cmd
      python main.py --products "jquery:1.11.3,1.11.5" --format json
   ```
   - Note: The variable is unset when the PowerShell session is closed.

**Persistent (All Future Sessions):**
1. Open PowerShell with administrative privileges.
2. Run the following command, replacing your_actual_api_key with your NVD API key:
   ```cmd
       [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("NVD_API_KEY", "your_actual_api_key", "User")
   ```
   - Use "Machine" instead of "User" for system-wide persistence (requires admin rights).
3. Open a new PowerShell session and verify with 
   ```bash
      $env:NVD_API_KEY
   ```
4. Run the script in the new session.

#### Linux/macOS (Terminal)
**Temporary (Current Session):**
1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following command, replacing your_actual_api_key with your NVD API key:
   ```bash
      export NVD_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   ```
3. Run the script in the same terminal session:
   ```bash
      python main.py --products "lodash:3.5.0" --format json
   ```
   - Note: The variable is unset when the terminal session is closed.

#### Persistent (All Future Sessions):
1. Open a terminal and edit your shell configuration file:
      - For Bash: nano ~/.bashrc or nano ~/.bash_profile
      - For Zsh: nano ~/.zshrc
2. Add the following line at the end, replacing your_actual_api_key with your NVD API key:
   ```bash
      export NVD_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
   ```
3. Save the file and exit (e.g., Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano).
4. Apply the changes by running:
   ```bash
      source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.bash_profile or source ~/.zshrc
   ```
5. Verify with 
   ```bash
      echo $NVD_API_KEY.
   ```
6. Run the script in the same or a new terminal session.
     - After setting the environment variable, run the script. If the key is not detected, the script will prompt for manual input.


#### Command-Line Options
   ```bash
      vuln-checker-help
   ```
**Examples:**
1. Single Product via Command-Line:
   ```bash
      vuln-checker --products "jquery:1.11.3,1.11.5 lodash:3.5.0" --format html --output custom_report.html
   ```
      - Fetches CVEs for multiple products/versions provided as a comma-separated list.

2. Batch Processing with CSV: 
     - Create a products.csv file with the following format:

          products,versions\
          jquery,1.11.3,1.11.5\
          lodash,3.5.0
     - Run:
       ```bash
          vuln-checker --input-csv products.csv --format csv --output output.csv
       ```
     - Processes all product/version pairs from the CSV.

3. Filter by Severity: 
   ```bash
      vuln-checker --products "jquery:1.11.3,1.11.5" --severity critical,high --format json --output output.json
   ```
      - Filters CVEs with HIGH severity only.

4.	Specify Output File: 
    ```bash
       vuln-checker --input-csv products.csv --format html --output custom_report.html
    ```
       - Saves the report to a custom file name.


## üì¶ New Features
**--version**

You can now check the current installed version of the vuln-checker tool using:

   ```bash
      vuln-checker --version
   ```
   - This fetches the version directly from the pyproject.toml file, ensuring consistency with your package metadata.

**--upgrade**
Easily upgrade to the latest version of vuln-checker from PyPI using:

  ```bash
      vuln-checker --upgrade
  ```

This command will:
1. Check the latest available version on PyPI.
2. Compare it with your currently installed version.
3. Only upgrade if a newer version is available.

To auto-confirm the upgrade (without a prompt), use the --yes flag:

  ```bash
      vuln-checker --upgrade --yes
  ```
‚ö†Ô∏è If you already have the latest version installed, the tool will skip the upgrade.

#### Arguments
      --input-csv INPUT_CSV         Path to CSV file with 'product' and 'version' columns
      --products PRODUCTS           Product/version mapping. Supports one or multiple products and versions. E.g., 'jquery:1.11.3,1.11.5 lodash:3.5.0,3.59'
      --cpes-file CPES_FILE         Optional path to a text file with CPEs (used to avoid NVD lookup if matched)
      --severity SEVERITY           Filter by comma-separated severities (e.g. LOW,HIGH,CRITICAL)
      --format {json,csv,html}      Output format
      --output OUTPUT               Output filename (e.g. report.html, results.csv, output.json)
      --version                     Show tool version
      --upgrade                     Upgrade vuln-checker to the latest version on PyPI
      --yes                         Auto-confirm prompts like upgrade confirmation

### Notes
1. Exactly one of --input-csv or --products must be provided.
2. Hyperlinks in CSV are formatted as Excel =HYPERLINK formulas, and in JSON as a dictionary with url and value fields.
3. The tool includes a 0.5-second delay between API requests to respect NVD rate limits.
