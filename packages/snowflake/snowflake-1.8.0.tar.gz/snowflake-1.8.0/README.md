The Snowflake Python API is the unified Python API across all Snowflake workloads, providing APIs for all Snowflake resources across data engineering, Snowpark, Snowpark ML, and client application workloads.

The `snowflake` package is the PEP 420 namespace parent package for the Snowflake Python API, including Snowpark.  
Installing snowflake automatically installs all subpackages as dependencies.
