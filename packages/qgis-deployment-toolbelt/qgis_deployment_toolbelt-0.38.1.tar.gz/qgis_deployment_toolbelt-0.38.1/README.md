**QGIS Deployment Toolbelt (QDT)** is a cross-platform (primarily Windows-focused) command-line tool that streamlines the deployment and management of **QGIS profiles**, **plugins**, and related settings within organizations.

It helps **standardize** user environments, **simplify** updates, and **integrate** with IT deployment strategies like **GPO**, **SCCM**, or **InTune**.

## ‚≠ê Why QDT?

- Save hours of manual QGIS configuration and profile management
- Reduce configuration errors and user friction
- Scale QGIS deployments in professional environments easily
- Community driven development and developed by experienced QGIS teams (especially [Oslandia](https://oslandia.com/))

Come, talk and ask, we're a friendly (small) group of persons behind:

- GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/qgis-deployment/qgis-deployment-toolbelt-cli/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/qgis-deployment/qgis-deployment-toolbelt-cli/discussions)
- Matrix channel: <https://matrix.to/#/#qdt:matrix.org>

## ‚ú® Features

- **Manage QGIS profiles easily**: define, store, and deploy profiles with a simple `profile.json` file.
- **Version control integration**: Git-powered backend for tracking changes and enabling collaborative profile management.
- **IT-friendly**: designed to work with Active Directory, GPOs, SCCM, InTune, and other enterprise tools.
- **Seamless user experience**: deliver a consistent QGIS experience across your organization with minimal friction.
- **Advanced configuration handling**: use variabilized `QGIS3.ini` files to handle dynamic or environment-specific settings.
- **Conditional deployments**: deploy specific profiles based on rules, environment variables, or user criteria.
- **Optimized plugin management** : reduce bandwidth usage by rationalizing plugin downloads and installations.

## üöÄ Try it quickly

You have multiple options to try QDT:

- Using Python and the official modern CLI installer [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/):

    ```sh
    pipx run qgis-deployment-toolbelt -s https://github.com/qgis-deployment/qgis-deployment-toolbelt-cli/raw/main/examples/scenarios/demo-scenario.qdt.yml
    ```

- Using Python and the official package installer `pip`:

    ```sh
    pip install qgis-deployment-toolbelt
    qdt -s https://github.com/qgis-deployment/qgis-deployment-toolbelt-cli/raw/main/examples/scenarios/demo-scenario.qdt.yml
    ```

- Using a pre-built executable (downloadable [through releases assets](https://github.com/qgis-deployment/qgis-deployment-toolbelt-cli/releases/latest)). For example on Windows:

    ```powershell
    ./Windows_QGISDeploymentToolbelt_0-37-0.exe  -s https://github.com/qgis-deployment/qgis-deployment-toolbelt-cli/raw/main/examples/scenarios/demo-scenario.qdt.yml
    ```

Once completed, check:

- The **Start menu** / **Desktop** for new shortcuts.
- The **QGIS Profiles menu** for new profiles.

Have you tried it on Linux? Well, you should find an additional profile simply named "QDT Only Linux".
