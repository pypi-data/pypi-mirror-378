## MOSAICX: The Foundation of Healthcare Data Transformation

MOSAICX represents the first intentional step toward building a living, breathing ecosystem for healthcare data intelligence. At DIGIT-X Lab, we believe that meaningful clinical insights begin with one fundamental challenge: **structuring the unstructured**.

Healthcare data is notoriously fragmented, locked in silos, and resistant to systematic analysis. MOSAICX addresses this by transforming unstructured medical documents into validated, interoperable data structures that become the foundation for connected healthcare intelligence.

**From this:**
```
"Pat.-Nr.: 111111111, geb. 13.03.1940, Müller, Jane
Transthorakale Echokardiographie vom 06.10.2020 10:45
Befund: Mitralklappe physiologische Insuffizienz..."
```

**To this:**
```json
{
  "patient_id": "111111111",
  "age": 80,
  "sex": "Female", 
  "mitral_valve_grade": "Normal",
  "tricuspid_valve_grade": "Mild"
}
```

This is not just data extraction. This is infrastructure—the systematic foundation that enables healthcare data to move, connect, and speak in a common language that both humans and AI can understand.

## 🚀 **Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: You need Ollama running locally before using MOSAICX**

MOSAICX uses local LLMs through Ollama for privacy and control. Install Ollama first:

**🖥️ Install Ollama:**
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Or visit https://ollama.com/download for Windows/GUI installers
```

**🤖 Install a compatible model:**
```bash
# Recommended: Fast and reliable for medical text
ollama pull gpt-oss:120b

# Alternative: Larger model for complex cases  
ollama pull llama3.1

# Verify Ollama is running
ollama list
```

### Installation

**Option 1: Standard Installation**
```bash
pip install mosaicx
```

**Option 2: With UV (Faster & Better)**
```bash
uv add mosaicx
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check if everything works
mosaicx --help

# Test with your installed model
mosaicx generate --desc "Patient demographics" --model gpt-oss:120b
```

### Complete Workflow Guide

**🔄 The MOSAICX Process: From Description to Data**

```bash
# Step 1: Generate your schema from natural language
mosaicx generate --desc "Echocardiography report with patient ID, age, sex, and all cardiac valve conditions including severity grades" --model gpt-oss:120b

# Step 2: See what schemas you have
mosaicx schemas

# Step 3: Extract data from your PDF
mosaicx extract --pdf echo_report.pdf --schema EchocardiographyReport --model gpt-oss:120b --save results.json

# Step 4: Repeat for more files
mosaicx extract --pdf another_report.pdf --schema EchocardiographyReport --model gpt-oss:120b
```

**💡 Pro Tips for Better Results:**

### 📝 **Writing Effective Descriptions**

**✅ DO:**
```bash
# Be specific about data types and medical domains
mosaicx generate --desc "Patient demographics (ID, age, sex, birth_date) plus cardiac valve assessment from echocardiography with severity grades (Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe) for mitral, aortic, tricuspid, and pulmonary valves"

# Include expected value formats  
mosaicx generate --desc "Lab results with numeric values: hemoglobin (g/dL), white blood cell count (cells/µL), platelet count (K/µL), and categorical blood type (A, B, AB, O with +/- Rh factor)"

# Mention the document source type
mosaicx generate --desc "Radiology report findings from MRI brain scans including lesion locations, sizes in mm, enhancement patterns, and radiologist impression"
```

**❌ DON'T:**
```bash
# Too vague - will generate generic fields
mosaicx generate --desc "patient data"

# Missing context - unclear what values to expect  
mosaicx generate --desc "heart information from reports"

# No data types - will guess incorrectly
mosaicx generate --desc "some medical stuff from PDFs"
```

### 🎯 **Schema Management Workflow**

```bash
# List all your generated schemas
mosaicx schemas

# Extract using different schema formats:
mosaicx extract --pdf report.pdf --schema EchoReport_20250919_143022        # Schema ID
mosaicx extract --pdf report.pdf --schema echoreport_patient_cardiac.py     # Filename  
mosaicx extract --pdf report.pdf --schema /path/to/schema/echoreport.py     # Full path
```

### 🔍 **Real Example: Complete Workflow**

Let's say you have echocardiography reports and want to extract structured data:

```bash
# 1. Generate schema with detailed description
mosaicx generate \
  --desc "Echocardiography report containing patient_id (string), age (integer), sex (Male/Female), exam_date (YYYY-MM-DD format), mitral_valve_condition (Normal/Mild/Moderate/Severe), aortic_valve_condition (Normal/Mild/Moderate/Severe), ejection_fraction (percentage as integer), and clinical_impression (free text)" \
  --model gpt-oss:120b

# Output: Created schema 'EchocardiographyReport_20250919_143022'

# 2. Verify your schema was created
mosaicx schemas
# Shows: EchocardiographyReport_20250919_143022 | Echocardiography report containing patient demographics and valve conditions

# 3. Extract from your first report
mosaicx extract \
  --pdf patient_001_echo.pdf \
  --schema EchocardiographyReport_20250919_143022 \
  --model gpt-oss:120b \
  --save patient_001_results.json

# 4. Extract from multiple reports (same schema)
mosaicx extract --pdf patient_002_echo.pdf --schema EchocardiographyReport_20250919_143022 --model gpt-oss:120b
mosaicx extract --pdf patient_003_echo.pdf --schema EchocardiographyReport_20250919_143022 --model gpt-oss:120b

# 5. Results saved as structured JSON ready for analysis!
```

**🎯 Pro Tip:** If you see "connection refused" errors, make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve` (usually runs automatically after installation)

## Building the Foundation for Connected Healthcare Intelligence

### **The Challenge We Address**

Healthcare generates vast amounts of data, yet most of it remains trapped in unstructured formats that resist systematic analysis. At DIGIT-X Lab, we recognized that before we can build intelligent systems that truly serve clinical care, we must solve the fundamental problem of **data structure**.

This is where meaningful healthcare AI begins—not with complex models, but with the infrastructure that allows medical data to be:
- **Structured** systematically and consistently
- **Connected** across clinical silos and departments  
- **Validated** against clinical standards and requirements
- **Transformed** into knowledge that supports decision-making

### **Our Vision: A Living Ecosystem**

MOSAICX is the first building block in our vision of a living, breathing ecosystem for healthcare data intelligence. We believe that when medical data is properly structured, insights should emerge as "free lunches"—natural byproducts of well-designed systems rather than labor-intensive manual processes.

**The ecosystem we're building:**

- �️ **Infrastructure-First**: Reliable, reproducible data transformation that scales
- 🔗 **Interconnected**: Systems that speak to each other in meaningful ways
- 🩺 **Clinically Grounded**: Tools built from real clinical needs, not theoretical possibilities
- � **Transparent**: AI that can explain its reasoning in natural language
- 🌱 **Evolving**: Adaptive systems that learn and improve with use

### **Why Structure Comes First**

In radiology—and healthcare broadly—the most sophisticated AI model is only as good as the data it can understand. Unstructured medical reports, imaging findings, and clinical notes represent decades of medical knowledge locked away from systematic analysis.

By solving the structuring problem first, we create the foundation for:
- **Longitudinal patient analysis** across multiple reports and timepoints
- **Cross-modal integration** linking imaging, lab results, and clinical notes
- **Population-level insights** drawn from properly standardized clinical data
- **Reproducible research** built on validated, structured datasets

MOSAICX transforms the labor-intensive process of manual data extraction into systematic, validated infrastructure that serves as the backbone for more sophisticated healthcare intelligence systems.

## Infrastructure for Medical Data Transformation

### **Systematic Data Pipeline**
```
📝 Clinical Description → 🤖 Local LLM → 🏗️ Validated Schema → 📄 Medical Document → 🔍 Structured Extraction → ✨ Interoperable Data
```

MOSAICX implements a systematic approach to medical data transformation that prioritizes reproducibility, clinical validity, and infrastructure scalability.

### **Schema-Driven Architecture**

**1. Intelligent Schema Generation** 
```bash
mosaicx generate --desc "Echocardiography report with comprehensive cardiac valve assessment" --model gpt-oss:120b
```

Our approach begins with **clinical intent**: you describe your data requirements in natural language, and MOSAICX generates validated Pydantic schemas that encode both structure and clinical semantics.

**Generated Infrastructure:**
```python
class EchocardiographyReport(BaseModel):
    patient_id: str = Field(description="Patient identifier")
    age: int = Field(description="Patient age in years", ge=0, le=150)
    mitral_valve_condition: Literal["Normal", "Mild", "Moderate", "Severe"] = Field(
        description="Mitral valve condition severity grade"
    )
    ejection_fraction: Optional[int] = Field(
        description="Left ventricular ejection fraction percentage",
        ge=15, le=80
    )
```

This is not just code generation—it's **clinical data infrastructure** with built-in validation, semantic clarity, and interoperability standards.

**2. Systematic Data Extraction**
```bash  
mosaicx extract --pdf echo_report.pdf --schema EchocardiographyReport --model gpt-oss:120b --save structured_data.json
```

**The extraction process prioritizes:**
- **Clinical accuracy** through schema-guided parsing
- **Data validation** with automatic constraint checking  
- **Reproducibility** via consistent local processing
- **Transparency** in how clinical concepts map to structured fields

**Structured Output:**
```json
{
  "patient_id": "0022768653",
  "age": 78,
  "mitral_valve_condition": "Mild", 
  "ejection_fraction": 55,
  "extraction_metadata": {
    "schema_version": "EchocardiographyReport_20250919_143022",
    "processing_timestamp": "2025-09-19T14:30:22Z",
    "validation_status": "PASSED"
  }
}
```

**3. Infrastructure for Scale**
```bash
mosaicx schemas  # Manage your data infrastructure assets
```

MOSAICX treats schemas as **infrastructure assets**—versioned, reusable, and designed for systematic deployment across clinical workflows.

**Key Infrastructure Principles:**
- **Local Processing**: All data transformation happens within your clinical environment
- **Schema Versioning**: Systematic tracking of data structure evolution
- **Validation Pipeline**: Built-in quality control for extracted data
- **Interoperability**: Standards-compliant output ready for downstream systems

**🔒 Privacy Note:** All LLM processing happens locally through Ollama. Your patient data never touches the internet.

## 🎓 **Advanced Usage & Best Practices**

### **🏆 Expert Tips for Schema Descriptions**

**📋 Template for Medical Reports:**
```bash
mosaicx generate --desc "[Document Type] containing [Demographics] (specify fields and types), [Clinical Data] (with units and value ranges), [Categorical Fields] (list expected values), and [Free Text Fields] (impression, notes, etc.)"
```

**🩺 Real-World Examples by Medical Domain:**

**Radiology Reports:**
```bash
mosaicx generate --desc "Brain MRI report with patient_id (string), scan_date (YYYY-MM-DD), sequence_types (T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI), lesion_count (integer), lesion_locations (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital), largest_lesion_size_mm (float), enhancement_pattern (none, ring, nodular), and radiologist_impression (free text)"
```

**Laboratory Results:**
```bash  
mosaicx generate --desc "Complete blood count results with patient_id (string), test_date (YYYY-MM-DD), hemoglobin_g_per_dl (float 10-18), hematocrit_percentage (float 30-50), white_blood_cells_per_ul (integer 4000-11000), platelet_count_k_per_ul (integer 150-450), and reference_ranges_exceeded (list of abnormal values)"
```

**Pathology Reports:**
```bash
mosaicx generate --desc "Surgical pathology report including patient_id (string), specimen_type (biopsy, resection, cytology), organ_system (breast, lung, colon, etc.), diagnosis_primary (free text), diagnosis_secondary (free text), tumor_size_cm (float), grade (1-4 or well/moderate/poor), stage_tnm (TNM format), margins_status (positive, negative, close), and pathologist_name (string)"
```

### **⚡ Performance Optimization**

**Model Selection Strategy:**
```bash
# Fast processing for simple extractions
mosaicx extract --pdf simple_report.pdf --schema SimpleSchema --model gpt-oss:120b

# Better accuracy for complex medical terminology  
mosaicx extract --pdf complex_report.pdf --schema ComplexSchema --model llama3.1

# Batch processing with consistent model
for pdf in reports/*.pdf; do
    mosaicx extract --pdf "$pdf" --schema MedicalReport --model gpt-oss:120b --save "results/$(basename "$pdf" .pdf).json"
done
```

### **🔍 Quality Control & Validation**

**Iterative Schema Refinement:**
```bash
# Start with basic schema
mosaicx generate --desc "Basic patient demographics and primary diagnosis"

# Test on a few files, then refine
mosaicx generate --desc "Patient demographics (patient_id as 8-digit number, age 0-120, sex as M/F only) plus primary_diagnosis (ICD-10 format preferred), secondary_diagnoses (list), and admission_date (MM/DD/YYYY format)"
```

**Result Verification:**
```bash
# Save results for manual review
mosaicx extract --pdf report.pdf --schema MySchema --model gpt-oss:120b --save results_to_review.json

# Use debug mode for problematic extractions
mosaicx extract --pdf problematic.pdf --schema MySchema --model gpt-oss:120b --debug
```
