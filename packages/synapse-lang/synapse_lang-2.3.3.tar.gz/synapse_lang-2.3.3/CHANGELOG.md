## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-07

### ðŸŽ‰ Initial Release

#### Added
- **Core Language Features**
  - Parallel execution with `parallel` blocks and branches
  - Uncertainty quantification with `uncertain` values and automatic error propagation
  - Scientific reasoning with `hypothesis` and `reason chain` constructs
  - Quantum computing support with quantum states and operators
  - Tensor operations with NumPy backend
  - Symbolic mathematics with SymPy integration

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Multi-level caching system (AST, computation, result caches)
  - JIT compilation support via Numba (optional)
  - GPU acceleration for tensor operations (CuPy/PyTorch)
  - Optimized interpreter with lazy evaluation
  - Parallel execution with thread pools

- **Developer Tools**
  - Interactive REPL with syntax highlighting
  - Comprehensive test suite
  - Performance benchmarking suite

  - VS Code extension (basic)

- **Package Features**
  - PyPI package with extras for gpu, jit, quantum features
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
  - Pre-commit hooks for code quality

#### Language Constructs
- `parallel {...}` - Parallel execution blocks
- `uncertain x = value Â± error` - Values with uncertainty
- `hypothesis {...}` - Scientific hypotheses
- `experiment {...}` - Experimental protocols
- `reason chain {...}` - Logical reasoning chains
- `pipeline {...}` - Data processing pipelines
- `tensor[dims]` - Multi-dimensional arrays
- `symbolic {...}` - Symbolic mathematics

#### Examples
- Quantum simulation demonstrations
- Climate modeling with uncertainty
- Drug discovery pipeline

## Upgrade Guide

### From Development Versions to 1.0.0

If you were using pre-release development versions:

1. **Update imports**: Change from individual module imports to package imports
   ```python
   # Old
   from synapse_interpreter import SynapseInterpreter
   
   # New
   from synapse_lang import SynapseInterpreter
   ```

2. **Update file extensions**: Use `.syn` for all Synapse source files

3. **Update CLI commands**: Use new entry points
   ```bash
   # Old
   python synapse_repl.py
   
   # New
   synapse-repl
   ```
