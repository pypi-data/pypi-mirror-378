**The Problem:** Your AI coding assistant has short-lived memory. Every chat session starts from a blank slate.

**The Solution:** Heimdall gives your LLM a persistent, growing, cognitive memory of your specific codebase, lessons and memories carry over time.

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Context-Rich Memory**: Heimdall learns from your documentation, session insights, and development history, allowing your LLM to recall specific solutions and architectural patterns across conversations.
- 📚 **Git-Aware Context**: It indexes your project's entire git history, understanding not just what changed, but also who changed it, when, and context.
- 🔗 **Isolated & Organized**: Each project gets its own isolated memory space, ensuring that context from one project doesn't leak into another.
- ⚡ **Efficient Integration**: Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it provides a standardized, low-overhead way for LLMs to access this powerful memory.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.11+ and Docker (for Qdrant vector database).

Heimdall provides a unified `heimdall` CLI that manages everything from project setup to MCP integration.

### 1. Install Heimdall

```bash
pip install heimdall-mcp
```

This installs the `heimdall` command-line tool with all necessary dependencies.

### 2. Initialize Your Project

Navigate to your project directory and set up Heimdall:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize project memory (starts Qdrant, creates collections, sets up config)
heimdall project init
```

This single command interactively builds up everything asking user preferences:
- ✅ Starts Qdrant vector database automatically
- ✅ Creates project-specific memory collections
- ✅ Sets up `.heimdall/` configuration directory
- ✅ Downloads required AI models
- ✅ File monitoring
- ✅ Git hooks
- ✅ MCP integration

**Note: this creates a `.heimdall/` directory in your project for configuration - you should NOT commit this - add to .gitignore!**

## Load Project Knowledge

**Recommended: Use automatic file monitoring** and place files in `.heimdall/docs/`:

```bash
# Copy or symlink your documentation to the monitored directory
ln -r -s my-project-docs ./.heimdall/docs/project-docs

# Start automatic monitoring (files are loaded instantly when changed)
heimdall monitor start
```

**Alternative: Manual loading** for one-time imports:

```bash
# Load documentation and files manually
heimdall load docs/ --recursive
heimdall load README.md
```

Your project's memory is now active and ready for your LLM.

#### Real-time Git Integration

You can parse your entire git history with:

```bash
# Load git commit history
heimdall git-load .
```

You can also install git hooks for automatic memory updates on commits:

```bash
# Install the post-commit hook (Python-based, cross-platform)
heimdall git-hooks install
```

**Note**: If you have existing post-commit hooks, they'll be safely chained and preserved - but proceed carefully.


## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove Heimdall from a project:

```bash
# Navigate to the project you want to clean up
cd /path/to/project

# Cleanup data, remove collections, uninstall git hooks
memory_system project clean
```

This cleanly removes project-specific data while preserving the shared Qdrant instance for other projects.

## ⚙️ How It Works Under the Hood

Heimdall extracts unstructured knowledge from your documentation and structured data from your git history. This information is vectorized and stored in a Qdrant database. The LLM can then query this database using a simple set of tools to retrieve relevant, context-aware information.

## LLM Tool Reference

You can instruct your LLM to use the following six tools to interact with its memory:

| Tool              | Description                                                          |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `store_memory`    | Stores a new piece of information, such as an insight or a solution. |
| `recall_memories` | Performs a semantic search for relevant memories based on a query.   |
| `session_lessons` | Records a key takeaway from the current session for future use.      |
| `memory_status`   | Checks the health and statistics of the memory system.               |
| `delete_memory`   | Delete a specific memory by its unique ID.                          |
| `delete_memories_by_tags` | Delete all memories that have any of the specified tags.    |


## 💡 Best Practices

To maximize the effectiveness of Heimdall:

  * **Provide Quality Documentation:** Think architecture decision records, style guides, and API documentation.
  * **Keep documents updated:** Heilmdall will use documents in `.heimdall/docs` to provide memories - if they are outdated, so will be the memories. We suggest you use symbolic links to your actual docs directory in `.heimdall/docs` so Heimdall automatically refreshes memories with latest document versions.
  * **Maintain Good Git Hygiene:** Write clear and descriptive commit messages. A message like `feat(api): add user authentication endpoint` is far more valuable than `more stuff`.
  * **Set Up Automation:** Use `heimdall monitor start` and `heimdall git-hooks install` for hands-free memory updates.
  * **Guide Your Assistant:** Use a system prompt (like a `CLAUDE.md` file) to instruct your LLM on *how* and *when* to use the available memory tools.
  * **Use Strategic Tagging:** Establish rules for your LLM to tag memories consistently. Use temporary tags like `temp-analysis`, `task-specific`, or `cleanup-after-project` for memories that should be deleted after completion, enabling easy cleanup with `delete_memories_by_tags`.
