# Lazy Ninja 

**Lazy Ninja** is a Django library that simplifies the generation of API endpoints using Django Ninja. It dynamically scans your Django models and generates Pydantic schemas for listing, retrieving, creating, and updating records. The library also allows you to customize behavior through hook functions (controllers) and schema configurations.

By leveraging Django Ninja, Lazy Ninja provides automatic, interactive API documentation via OpenAPI, making it easy to visualize and interact with your endpoints.

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a simple example of integrating Lazy Ninja into your Django project:
