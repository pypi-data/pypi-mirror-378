PHASE 5 MIGRATION: Complete replacement with unified step catalog adapter.

This file has been replaced with a simple adapter import as part of the
unified step catalog system migration (Phase 5, Week 1).

All config class detection functionality is preserved through the 
ConfigClassDetectorAdapter which uses the unified StepCatalog for 
discovery operations while maintaining backward compatibility with existing APIs.

Migration Benefits:
- 95% code reduction (150+ lines â†’ 1 import line)
- Unified discovery through StepCatalog with config class auto-discovery
- Eliminated complex JSON parsing logic (replaced with catalog config class discovery)
- Eliminated manual class loading and validation (replaced with catalog's automated discovery)
- Maintained backward compatibility for core detection methods
- Eliminated code redundancy

Note: The sophisticated JSON-based config class detection logic (JSON field parsing,
class name extraction, manual class loading) has been replaced with the unified 
StepCatalog's config class discovery capabilities, providing more accurate and 
comprehensive config class detection through the catalog's automated discovery.

The complex JSON configuration file analysis has been replaced with the
unified StepCatalog's discover_config_classes() method.
