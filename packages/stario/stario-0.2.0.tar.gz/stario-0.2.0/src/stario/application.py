        Parameters:
            routes: A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests.
            middleware: A list of middleware to run for every request. A starlette
                application will always automatically include two middleware classes.
                `ServerErrorMiddleware` is added as the very outermost middleware, to handle
                any uncaught errors occurring anywhere in the entire stack.
                `ExceptionMiddleware` is added as the very innermost middleware, to deal
                with handled exception cases occurring in the routing or endpoints.
            compression_middleware: A middleware class to compress the responses.
                By default we opt for brotli compression with gzip fallback.
                Parameters are what we think are reasonable for most use cases.
                If you need tweaking those try `BrotliMiddleware.as_middleware()`.
            exception_handlers: A mapping of either integer status codes,
                or exception class types onto callables which handle the exceptions.
                Exception handler callables should be of the form
                `handler(request, exc) -> response` and may be either standard functions, or
                async functions.
            lifespan: A lifespan context function, which can be used to perform
                startup and shutdown tasks. This is a newer style that replaces the
                `on_startup` and `on_shutdown` handlers. Use one or the other, not both.
            debug: Boolean indicating if debug tracebacks should be returned on errors.
            router_class: A class to use for the router. By default we use `StarRouter`.
                You can use this to customize the behaviour of the app, just consider
                what are the implications :)
