# RESTEP



**R**eason-based RAG for **E**arly-**St**ag**e** Developers for Community-based **P**rospecting (**RE-STEP**) is a GenAI prospecting tool to assess community-based factors in early-stage renewable-energy siting. It is targeted for early-stage developers in the renewable energy industry.







## Requirements  

### Required packages





The following packages are required for `restep`:



- `torch` (to learn how to install, please refer to [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/))

- `transformers`

- `accelerate`

- `safetensors`

- `sentencepiece`

- `bitsandbytes`

- `requests`

- `PyPDF2`

- `python-docx`

- `langchain`

- `tqdm`



To install these packages, you can do the following:



```bash

pip install torch transformers accelerate safetensors sentencepiece bitsandbytes requests PyPDF2 python-docx langchain tqdm

```



### GPU requirements

You require at least one GPU to use `restep`.  

VRAM requirements depend on factors like the length of the document.  

However, at least 16GB of VRAM is recommended



### huggingface access token

You will need a huggingface access token. To obtain one:  

1. you'd first need to create a [huggingface](https://huggingface.co) account if you do not have one. 

2. Create and store a new access token. To learn more, please refer to [huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens).  

3. Note: Some pre-trained large language models (LLMs) may require permissions. For more information, please refer to [huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated).  

4. Request for permission for `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` at https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. 







## Installation

To install in python, simply do the following: 

```bash

pip install restep

```





## Quick Start



Here we provide a quick example on how you can execute `restep` by providing a link to the local government document and your huggingface API key. 

```python

from restep import restep

api_key="<your huggingface API key>"

url_to_local_government_document"https://www.co.marshall.in.us/egov/documents/1739816106_82896.pdf"

print(restep(url_to_local_government_document,api_key))



# This will return: {"Sentiment": "NEGATIVE", "Summary": "Opposition from residents and board members, citing concerns over property values, wildlife, and agricultural land, with some board members questioning the project's compliance with the ordinance and requesting additional conditions."}

```
