Classify the community stance toward NEW renewable investments from an INVESTOR RISK perspective.

RUBRIC (prioritize enforceable actions over commentary):
- NEGATIVE (default if material friction exists): moratoriums/bans/denials; moves toward them; stricter siting (bigger setbacks/lot sizes);
  litigation threats/appeals/petitions; nuisance/impact objections (noise, glare/flicker, wildlife/birds, viewshed, property values, tax-revenue fears);
  expensive studies/mitigations/bonds imposed. These raise cost, delay, or denial risk.
- POSITIVE: approvals/votes passed; enabling overlays/code updates that make siting easier; incentives/grants; supportive officials.
- NEUTRAL: only if the text lacks clear enabling actions AND lacks clear friction. Ambiguous “concerns” without action do NOT outweigh restrictions.

Note:
1. Be careful in detecting not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) situations, where the community may seem to be friendly and open to certain demands (e.g., visual concerns),
but are using 'excuses' like visual concerns or wildlife damage as a pretext to oppose renewables without explicitly having to say so.  
2. Investments towards solar energy, any green iniatives or anything that could potential encourage future solar investment should be viewed as a positive!
3. Positive comments (e.g., desire for solar and EVs) made towards renewables should be considered POSITIVE. 
4. Negative comments or anti-renewable commments should always be considered NEGATIVE.
