# TabNN

**TabNN** is a tabular neural network classifier that supports overlapping input features and targets. This means a column in the training dataset can be specified as an input feature, a target, or both. If a column is specified as either an input or a target only, the model behaves as expected: at inference time, the input columns are used to predict the target columns. If a column is specified as both an input and a target, then at inference time it is treated as an input if a value is provided; otherwise, it is treated as a target. This allows TabNN to be used for both typical classification tasks and tabular data imputation.

`TabNNModel` includes the method `feature_importance_scores()`, which computes feature importance scores as the mean absolute value of *input × gradient* across the dataset. These values reflect how sensitive the model’s output is to small changes in each input feature, which serves as a proxy for how much each feature influences the prediction. A higher score means the model output is more sensitive to that feature. The scores can be min–max normalized by setting the parameter `normalize=True` for improved interpretability.

## Installation

`pip install tabnn`

## Example usage

In addition to `tabnn` The example below uses the `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn` libraries:

`pip install pandas scikit-learn` (installing `pandas` will also install `numpy`)

Get the Titanic dataset, e.g., from here: https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/blob/master/titanic.csv

```Python

from tabnn.model import TabNNModel
from tabnn.utils import random_masking

# Example dataset
df = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")

# Define inputs and targets (notice that "Pclass", "Sex", and "SibSp" appear in both lists)
input_features = ["Pclass", "Sex", "Age", "SibSp", "Parch", "Fare", "Cabin", "Embarked"]
