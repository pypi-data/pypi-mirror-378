# micro-lm

NGF-powered micro-LMs: lightweight, domain-specific reasoning sidecars.  
This repo is a research testbed: first for **ARC** (visual reasoning), then for a **DeFi** PoC — both built on top of the `ngeodesic` Python package.

## Comparing LLMs vs. micro-LMs 

| Dimension | Tier-1 LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Meta, Perplexity, etc.) | **micro-LM Tier-1 (DeFi)** |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Domain accuracy** | Broad coverage, but DeFi primitives are not a training focus. Accuracy drifts under phrasing changes. | Mapper trained on 1k–5k usecase prompts (eg. DeFi, ARC). Benchmarked accuracy > 98% on 8 DeFi primitives; abstains correctly when uncertain. |
| **Determinism** | Outputs vary run-to-run (sampling drift). Even `temperature=0` doesn’t guarantee identical results. | Stage-11 NGF rails (Warp → Detect → Denoise) yield reproducible traces. Perturbation tests confirm stable decisions. |
| **Safety / Policy enforcement** | Can be prompted with “stay under LTV 0.75,” but no hard guarantees — may still propose unsafe actions. | Built-in verifiers: Loan-to-Value (LTV), Health Factor (HF), Oracle freshness. Unsafe paths always block or abstain. |
| **Abstain behavior** | Rarely abstains — tends to “make something up” even when uncertain. | Explicit abstain mode: non-exec prompts (balance checks, nonsense) → abstain with clear reason (`abstain_non_exec`). |
| **Auditability** | Opaque; no structured rationale. | Every run produces machine-readable artifacts: mapper score, abstain reason, verifier tags, plan trace. Auditable for compliance. |
| **Efficiency / Cost** | 10s–100s of billions of params; inference is slow/expensive. | SBERT (~22M params) + lightweight classifier. Fast, cheap, deployable in CI. |
| **Regulatory / Compliance fit** | Hard to certify (stochastic, unexplainable). | Deterministic + auditable by design. Built for domains where regulators demand safety. |

### **Summary**
- **Tier-1 LLMs = generalists**: broad knowledge, flexible language, but *stochastic and unsafe* for mission-critical DeFi execution.  
- **micro-lm Tier-1 = specialist**: slim, deterministic, auditable, and *more accurate where it matters* (DeFi primitives, policy enforcement, reproducibility).


---

## What’s included
- **ARC micro-LM (stresstest usecase) :** a compact, NGF-style classifier that detects and orders latent “primitives” on SBERT ARC-like traces. It demonstrates the **Adapter → Detect** path and stable metrics.
- **DeFi micro-LM (business usecase):** same skeleton, different adapter — turn market features into latent traces and reuse the exact parser/denoiser stack.

> NGF’s repeatable pipeline: **Adapter → Warp → Detect → Denoise → Execute → Verify**. Here we focus on Adapter→Detect (+optional Denoise) for a small, reliable sidecar you can pair with a larger LLM.


### Foundation: `ngeodesic` (NGF Stage-10/11)

- **Stage-10 (Parser):** matched-filter parsing with dual thresholds (absolute vs null; relative vs best channel), then ordering by peak time.
- **Stage-11 (Denoise):** stabilization via hybrid EMA+median smoothing, confidence gates, seed-jitter averaging — the Warp→Detect→Denoise doctrine to suppress phantoms.

These are provided by the `ngeodesic` package and reused here without modification.

## Micro-LM: Tiered Plan of Attack

This repo hosts experiments in **micro-scale language models** with **domain-specific reasoning**. Our current focus is the DeFi domain for the usecase, and ARC to highlight the extent of its potential, and yet the architecture generalizes to other verticals. Each tier represents an increasing level of capability and integration. 

---

### **Tier-0: Baseline Deterministic Rails (✔ Secured)**  
- **Stock matched filter + parser** pipeline.  
- Supports core DeFi primitives with deterministic abstain paths.  
- Sandbox verified and benchmarked with stable execution.

**Status:** ✅ Complete — foundation secured.

### **Tier-1: Micro-LM on SBERT Latents (✔ Secured)**  
- Replace hashmap lookups with a **trained micro-LM encoder**.  
- Train against **2–5k SBERT latent prompts**.
- Audit results to return ABSTAIN / PASS with auditable trace
- Benchmark with full Stage-11 runner on DeFi suites (**1% hallucination / 0.98 F1 Score** across 8 primitives)

**Status:** ✅ Complete — MVP secured.

### **Tier-2: Incorporate WDD with SBERT Latents (In Progress)**  
- Add **Warp → Detect → Denoise (WDD)** pipeline.
- Handle both DeFi (usecase) and ARC (aptitute) prompts
- Audit results using WDD to return ABSTAIN / PASS with auditable trace
- Stress test signal separation + denoising with SBERT latents.

**Status:** 🚧 Proven — WDD LLM benchmarks confirm deterministic reasoning on ARC and DeFi SBERT latents.

### **Tier-3: LLM Latents (End Goal)**  
- Swap SBERT latents for **LLM model latents**.  
- Validate micro-LM when paired with LLM systems as sidecar.

**Status:** 🔮 Planning stage — future work, not required for MVP.

---

**Roadmap Summary:**  
- Tiers 0 + 1 provide a safe, working MVP with deterministic rails and micro-LM reasoning on SBERT latents.
- Tier 2 expands the scope of what micro-LM can do using WDD
- Tier 3 remains a the end goal: sidecar integration for LMM latents, to be explored later.

## Quickstart

``` python
from micro_lm.core.runner import run_micro

# Example prompt
prompt = "deposit 10 ETH into aave"

# Minimal policy & context
policy = {
    "mapper": {
        "model_path": ".artifacts/defi_mapper.joblib",
        "confidence_threshold": 0.5,
    }
}
context = {}

# Run through micro-lm pipeline
out = run_micro(
    domain="defi",
    prompt=prompt,
    context=context,
    policy=policy,
    rails="stage11",
    T=180,
    backend="wordmap",   # or "sbert"
)

print(out)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ Example Output

``` python
{
  'ok': True,
  'label': 'deposit_asset',
  'score': 0.71,
  'reason': 'shim:accept:stage-4',
  'artifacts': {
    'mapper': {
      'score': 0.71,
      'reason': 'heuristic:deposit',
      'aux': {'reason': 'heuristic:deposit'}
    },
    'verify': {
      'ok': True,
      'reason': 'shim:accept:stage-4'
    },
    'schema': {
      'v': 1,
      'keys': ['mapper', 'verify']
    }
  }
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🔎 Output Breakdown

#### Top-level fields

-   **`ok: True`** → Overall run succeeded, action allowed.\
-   **`label: 'deposit_asset'`** → Canonical intent chosen.\
-   **`score: 0.71`** → Mapper's confidence.\
-   **`reason: 'shim:accept:stage-4'`** → Accepted by Stage-4 rails
    shim.

### Artifacts

-   **`mapper`**
    -   Raw mapper result.\
    -   Score + heuristic reason.
-   **`verify`**
    -   Rails/audit check result.\
    -   `ok=True` → passed safety/policy.
-   **`schema`**
    -   Metadata about which artifact keys exist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 Interpretation

This tells us:\
1. Prompt looked like a **deposit**.\
2. Mapper classified with \~71% confidence.\
3. Audit/rails verifier confirmed no violations.\
4. Final decision → **allow**, with `deposit_asset` as the action.
