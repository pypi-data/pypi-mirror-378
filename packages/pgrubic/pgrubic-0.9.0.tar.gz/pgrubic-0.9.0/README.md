pgrubic is a PostgreSQL linter and formatter for schema migrations and design best practices.

## Features

- Over 100+ rules
- Automatic violation correction (e.g., automatically add `concurrently` to index create statements)
- River style code formatting for DML statements
- Almost identical stying with **pg_dump** for DDL statements
- Python 3.12+ compatibility
- Automatic caching to avoid reformatting unchanged files
- Violations suppression, statement level, and file level

## Getting Started

For more, see the [documentation](https://bolajiwahab.github.io/pgrubic/).

## Installation

```bash
pip install pgrubic
```

**<span style="color:red">pgrubic is only supported on Python 3.12 or higher</span>**.

## Usage

For linting, try any of the following:

```bash
pgrubic lint                         # Lint SQL files in the current directory (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic lint .                       # Lint SQL files in the current directory (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic lint directory               # Lint SQL files in *directory* (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic lint directory/*.sql         # Lint SQL files in *directory*
pgrubic lint directory/file.sql      # Lint `file.sql` in *directory*
pgrubic lint file.sql                # Lint `file.sql`
pgrubic lint directory/*.sql --fix   # Lint SQL files in *directory* and fix violations automatically
pgrubic lint file.sql --fix          # Lint `file.sql` and fix fixable violations automatically
```

Sample output from linting:

```bash
pgrubic lint *.sql

file.sql:1:38: TP017: Boolean field should be not be nullable

1 | ALTER TABLE public.example ADD COLUMN foo boolean DEFAULT false;
```

```bash
pgrubic file.sql

test.sql:1:38: TP017: Boolean field should be not be nullable

1 | ALTER TABLE public.example ADD COLUMN foo boolean DEFAULT false;
```

For formatting, try any of the following:

```bash
pgrubic format                         # Format SQL files in the current directory (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic format .                       # Format SQL files in the current directory (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic format directory               # Format SQL files in *directory* (and any subdirectories)
pgrubic format directory/*.sql         # Format SQL files in *directory*
pgrubic format directory/file.sql      # Format `file.sql` in *directory*
pgrubic format file.sql                # Format `file.sql`
pgrubic format directory/*.sql --check # Check if SQL files would have been modified, returning a non-zero exit code
pgrubic format file.sql --diff         # Report if `file.sql` would have been modified, returning a non-zero exit code as well the difference between `file.sql` and how the formatted file would look like
```

pgrubic can also be used as a pre-commit hook:

```
- repo: https://github.com/bolajiwahab/pgrubic
  rev: 0.9.0
  hooks:
    - id: pgrubic-lint
    - id: pgrubic-format
```

## Configuration

pgrubic can be configured via the [`pgrubic.toml`] file in either the current directory, up to the root directory or the path set by the `PGRUBIC_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

The following configuration options are available in the [`pgrubic.toml`] with the following defaults:
