    Checks for usage of table inheritance.

    ## **Why not?**
    Table inheritance was a part of a fad wherein the database was closely coupled to
    object-oriented code. It turned out that coupling things that closely didn't
    actually produce the desired results.

    ## **When should you?**
    Never â€¦almost. Now that table partitioning is done natively, that common use case
    for table inheritance has been replaced by a native feature that handles tuple
    routing, etc., without bespoke code. One of the very few exceptions would be
    temporal_tables extension if you are in a pinch and want to use that for row
    versioning in place of a lacking SQL 2011 support. Table inheritance will provide a
    small shortcut instead of using UNION ALL to get both historical as well as current
    rows. Even then you ought to be wary of caveats while working with parent table.

    ## **Use instead:**
    Don't use table inheritance. Use declarative partitioning.
