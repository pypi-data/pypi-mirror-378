## Project Overview

This project is a Python library named `netlistx`. Its purpose is to provide tools for working with netlists, which are representations of electronic circuits. The library defines classes and functions for creating, manipulating, and analyzing netlists, leveraging graph theory concepts and the `networkx` library.

The core of the library is the `Netlist` class, which represents a circuit as a graph of modules (components) and nets (wires). It also includes various algorithms for solving graph problems, such as finding minimum covers for edges and cycles.

The project is structured as a standard Python package using `pyscaffold`.

## Building and Running

### Dependencies

The main dependencies are `networkx` and `mywheel` (a custom library from a git repository). Development and testing dependencies include `pytest`, `flake8`, `black`, `isort`, and `tox`.

### Building the Package

To build the source and wheel distributions:

```bash
tox -e build
```

The artifacts will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Tests

The project uses `pytest` for testing and `tox` to automate the process. To run the test suite:

```bash
tox
```

or simply:

```bash
pytest
```

### Linting

The project uses `flake8` for linting. The CI pipeline runs the following command:

```bash
flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
```

## Development Conventions

The project follows standard Python development conventions and uses several tools to enforce code quality and style.

### Code Style

*   **Formatting:** `black` is used for code formatting.
*   **Import Sorting:** `isort` is used to organize imports.
*   **Linting:** `flake8` is used to check for style and quality issues.

These checks are automated using `pre-commit` hooks, which are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Contributors are expected to install and use these hooks.

### Contribution Guidelines

Detailed contribution guidelines are provided in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The workflow involves:

1.  Forking the repository.
2.  Creating a feature branch.
3.  Installing dependencies and `pre-commit` hooks.
4.  Making changes, including adding tests and documentation.
5.  Running tests with `tox`.
6.  Submitting a pull request.

### Documentation

The documentation is built using `Sphinx` and can be generated by running:

```bash
tox -e docs
```

The output will be in `docs/_build/html`.
