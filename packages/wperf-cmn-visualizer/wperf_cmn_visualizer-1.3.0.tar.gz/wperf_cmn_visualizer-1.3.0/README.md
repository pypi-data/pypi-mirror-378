This is a Python project that provides a GUI-based visualizer for Arm CMN (Coherent Mesh Network) systems. It parses and displays information generated by [WindowsPerf](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf) and [Topdown Tool](https://gitlab.arm.com/telemetry-solution/telemetry-solution/-/tree/main/tools/topdown_tool), presenting their output files in an interactive interface. The visualizer enables analysis of topology, traffic, and performance metrics using PMU data from XPs, DTCs, and related components—helping engineers identify bottlenecks and understand system behavior across complex SoCs.
