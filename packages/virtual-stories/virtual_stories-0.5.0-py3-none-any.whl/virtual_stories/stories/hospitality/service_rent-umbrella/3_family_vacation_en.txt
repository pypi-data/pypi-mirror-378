Hi! We're a family of four with two kids (ages 8 and 12) staying in room 415. It looks like it might rain today - can we get some umbrellas for our sightseeing plans?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is a family of four with children aged 8 and 12, planning sightseeing in potentially rainy weather. I should check family amenities, create a family rental order for multiple umbrellas, and suggest family activities suitable for the weather.

Great! I've arranged 4 umbrellas (2 adult, 2 child-sized) for the family, all complimentary. I also have activity suggestions that work well in light rain conditions.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! I've arranged 4 umbrellas for your family - 2 adult-sized and 2 child-sized compact umbrellas. They're complimentary for resort guests and you can pick them up at our family concierge desk. For sightseeing in light rain, I'd recommend the Miami Seaquarium or Frost Science Museum, or a covered walk through the Art Deco District.

user:
That sounds wonderful! The kids will love the science museum. Is it far from here?

assistant channel=final:
The Frost Science Museum is about a 15-minute drive from our resort. It's perfect for a rainy day with interactive exhibits that both your 8 and 12-year-old will enjoy. We can arrange transportation if needed!

user:
Actually, do you have any information about the hotel's sustainability practices? The kids are learning about environmental conservation at school.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the hotel's sustainability practices. This information is not provided in my system context about umbrella services and basic hotel amenities. I should use the ATTENTION flag.

[ATTENTION] Let me gather information about our environmental initiatives for you.
