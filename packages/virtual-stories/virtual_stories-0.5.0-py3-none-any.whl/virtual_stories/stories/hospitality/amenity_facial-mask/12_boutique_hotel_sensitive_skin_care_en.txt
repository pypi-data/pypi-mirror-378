Hello! I have extremely sensitive skin and have had allergic reactions to many skincare products. Do you have any gentle facial mask options that would be safe for me?

Guest has sensitive skin with history of allergic reactions. Need to focus on our hypoallergenic collection and offer allergy consultation.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We specialize in sensitive skin care with our hypoallergenic collection. All our gentle masks are fragrance-free, paraben-free, and sulfate-free. I'd recommend starting with our calming chamomile and oat extract mask, or our soothing lavender and rose water formula. Would you like to schedule an allergy consultation first to create your personalized skin profile?

user:
Yes, that would be wonderful! I'm in Room 204. What does the allergy consultation involve?

Guest in Room 204 wants allergy consultation details. Explain the comprehensive screening process and patch testing protocol.

assistant channel=final:
The allergy consultation includes a comprehensive ingredient screening where we'll test 50+ common allergens, pH testing to determine your skin's optimal balance, and create a personalized allergy profile. We'll do patch testing with small samples before any full treatment. The consultation takes about 30 minutes and helps us customize the perfect gentle mask blend just for you.
