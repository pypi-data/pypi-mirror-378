Hi! Love the planters in the atrium. I want to enroll in the green program and still get fresh hand towels daily—possible?

Small talk acknowledged; enroll guest; program allows choice—daily hand towels can be requested while keeping other items reusable; describe pickup cadence.

Great to hear! I’ve enrolled your room. We’ll keep bath linens on the reuse plan, and I’ll schedule fresh hand towels daily. Soiled pickups are 10:00–13:00 with replenishment by 15:00. You’ll also receive a reusable glass bottle for your stay.
