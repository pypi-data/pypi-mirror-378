Hello! I'm so glad you reached out about your nut allergies—we take allergen safety very seriously here at Harmony Wellness Retreat. I've scheduled a complete sterilization cleaning for room 303 with our nut-free protocol. Emma will perform a thorough deep clean, replace all fabrics with hypoallergenic materials, and set up an air purifier. I've also included some allergen-free snacks for your comfort. This will take about 30 minutes. Do you have any other allergies or special needs?

user:
That's very reassuring! I'm also sensitive to strong scents, so if you could make sure no fragrances are used, that would be great. What's the most popular wellness activity here at Harmony?

assistant channel=analysis:
Update the cleaning request to include fragrance-free protocol and engage in conversation about wellness activities.

Cleaning protocol updated with fragrance-free requirements. Share information about popular wellness activities.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! I've updated the protocol to be completely fragrance-free—no cleaning products with any scents will be used. Our most popular wellness activity is the sunrise meditation in the red rock garden, followed closely by our sound bath healing sessions. Both are incredibly popular with our guests. Your specialized cleaning will be complete in about 35 minutes, and Emma will ensure the entire space is safe and comfortable for you.

user:
That sounds amazing! I think I'll try the sunrise meditation. Thank you for being so thorough with my accommodations.

You're very welcome! The sunrise meditation is a beautiful experience—I'll make sure you're on the list for tomorrow. Your room will be completely prepared with the sterile, fragrance-free environment you need.
