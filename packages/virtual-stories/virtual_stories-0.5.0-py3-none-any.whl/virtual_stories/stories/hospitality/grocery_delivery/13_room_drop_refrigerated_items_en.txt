Can you deliver milk and yogurt while I’m out for dinner and keep them cold?

Yes, we can hold cold items up to 2 hours and deliver on call.

Yes—if you’re out, we’ll label and hold milk and yogurt in our fridge for up to 2 hours, leave a door tag with a time stamp, and deliver to your room as soon as you call Ext. 640.

user:
Great. How about ice cream if I’m not back yet?

assistant channel=analysis:
System says ice cream allowed only if guest present.

Ice cream requires you to be present at drop-off; we don’t store it.

Also—what’s a nice beach to watch the sunset?

Out of scope; provide ATTENTION response.
