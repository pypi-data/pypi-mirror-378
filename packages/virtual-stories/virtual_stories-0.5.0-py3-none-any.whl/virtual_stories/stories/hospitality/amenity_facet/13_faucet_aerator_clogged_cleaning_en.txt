Hi there! I'm in room 2156 and the bathroom sink water flow is really weak. It's like a trickle instead of a normal stream. Is this something you can fix?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest reporting weak water flow in room 2156. This is typically a clogged aerator issue, especially common in Phoenix due to hard water and desert sediment. Need to explain the cleaning process.

assistant channel=final:
That sounds like a clogged aerator issue, which is common in Phoenix due to our hard water and desert environment. I'll have our plumbing specialist clean the aerator in room 2156—this usually restores full flow within 15 minutes. Our high-efficiency aerators are designed to handle desert conditions, but occasional cleaning keeps them optimal.

user:

No problem! I'll ask at the pool area. Thanks for the quick fix on the faucet.
