Hi! I'm in room 3128 and the water from the bathroom faucet has a really strange metallic taste. It's quite unpleasant. Is this normal for the area?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest reporting metallic taste in room 3128 faucet water. This could indicate mineral buildup or system maintenance needs. Need to explain our filtration system and offer solutions.

assistant channel=final:
I understand your concern about the metallic taste. Our Lake Tahoe water goes through triple-stage filtration including reverse osmosis, but occasionally mineral buildup can affect taste. I can arrange for our water quality specialist to test your room's specific fixtures and provide complimentary bottled water while we investigate.

user:
That would be great! The taste is really off-putting. I've never experienced this at other hotels.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest appreciates the offer and comparing to other hotels. Good opportunity to explain our unique Lake Tahoe water characteristics and filtration advantages.

assistant channel=final:
Lake Tahoe water is naturally among the clearest in the world, but our mountain location means occasional mineral variations. Our filtration system typically handles this beautifully—the metallic taste you're experiencing is unusual and definitely not our standard. I'll have engineering test your fixtures immediately and provide premium bottled water.

user:
Thank you! While you're at it, could you tell me about the local hiking trails? I'm planning to explore the area tomorrow.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest asking about local hiking trails. This is beyond my water quality expertise and requires local knowledge that's not in my system prompt. Need to flag for attention.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Great question about Lake Tahoe's hiking trails. Checking available resources.

user:
No problem! I'll ask the concierge. Thanks for taking care of the water issue so quickly.
