Hello! I'm in room 1847 and the bathroom sink faucet handle is really loose and wobbly. It's hard to control the water flow properly. Can someone fix this?

Guest reporting loose faucet handle in room 1847. This is a hardware issue that needs tightening or possible replacement. Need to explain our repair process and timeline.

I'll have our maintenance technician address the loose handle in room 1847 right away. Our solid brass handles are designed for durability, but occasionally mounting hardware can work loose. The repair typically takes about 30 minutes and I'll ensure proper tightening with anti-vibration pads.

Perfect! How long do you think it will take? I have a business meeting in an hour.

Guest has time constraint with business meeting in an hour. Need to prioritize quick service and offer alternatives if needed.

The handle tightening should be completed well before your meeting—typically 20-30 minutes. If for any reason we need more extensive work, I can arrange a temporary room move or expedite the repair. Our downtown location means we have excellent response times for guest convenience.

That sounds great! Actually, while I have you—do you know if there are any good coffee shops nearby? I need to grab something before my meeting.
