How sturdy are the edges on your king mattresses? I tend to sit when putting on boots.

Provide edge support detail for Standard King from system.

Our standard king hybrids have reinforced edges with a firm perimeter, designed to stay supportive when seated—great for booting up after skiing.

No—the edge reinforcement remains the same regardless of topper choice.
