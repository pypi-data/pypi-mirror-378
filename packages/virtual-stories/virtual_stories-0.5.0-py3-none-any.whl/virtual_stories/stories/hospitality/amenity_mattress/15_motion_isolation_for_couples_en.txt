We wake each other up when turning over. Which beds reduce that the most?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide motion isolation ranking and split‑king option.

assistant channel=final:
Memory foam performs best for motion isolation (9–10/10), followed by hybrid (8–9/10). For maximum separation, a split‑king—two XL twins side‑by‑side—minimizes transfer between sleepers.
