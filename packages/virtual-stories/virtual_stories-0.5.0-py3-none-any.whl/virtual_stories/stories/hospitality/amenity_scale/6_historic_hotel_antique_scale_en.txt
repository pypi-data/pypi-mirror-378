This hotel has such a rich history. When was the original wing built?

assistant channel=analysis:
Chitchat about hotel history - information available in system prompt about historic features and Victorian architecture.

assistant channel=final:
The original Victorian wing was built in 1852 and has been lovingly preserved with its mahogany paneling, crystal chandeliers, and period furnishings. The heritage tea room dates back to the original construction.

How much would an antique scale like this be worth if I wanted to purchase one?
