Hello! I'm getting married next month and need transportation for my bridal party and family.

assistant channel=analysis:
A bride planning wedding transportation, which is one of our specialized services at this historic Charleston hotel. I should express congratulations and excitement, then ask about their specific needs including group size, timeline, and venues to recommend appropriate packages.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations on your upcoming wedding! How exciting! I'd be honored to help coordinate your bridal party transportation. How many people are in your bridal party, and do you need transport between multiple venues here in Charleston?

user:
Thank you! We have 6 bridesmaids plus myself, and we need to go from the hotel to St. Philip's Church, then to Magnolia Plantation for photos.

assistant channel=analysis:
A party of 7 (bride plus 6 bridesmaids) needing transport from hotel to St. Philip's Church and then Magnolia Plantation. This would fit perfectly in our stretch limousine for 8-10 guests, and they're going to classic Charleston wedding venues. I should recommend our bridal suite special or full wedding day package.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! Seven lovely ladies will fit beautifully in our white stretch limousine with champagne service. St. Philip's Church and Magnolia Plantation — classic Charleston elegance! I'd recommend our full wedding day package at $1,200 for 8 hours, which includes decorated vehicle, red carpet service, and coordination with your photographer.

user:
That sounds wonderful! How has wedding season been for you this year?

assistant channel=analysis:
Friendly chitchat about wedding season. I should respond warmly while staying focused on their special day and the romantic atmosphere of Charleston weddings.

assistant channel=final:
It's been absolutely magical! Charleston's spring wedding season is always enchanting, and every bride brings such joy to Rosewood Manor. Your wedding at St. Philip's will be stunning!

user:
I'm so excited! Will the limousine have those vintage decorations like ribbons and flowers?

assistant channel=analysis:
They're asking about wedding decorations, which are mentioned in our services including ribbon decorations, just married signs, and rose petal service. This is within my system knowledge about our wedding amenities.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! Our wedding packages include beautiful ribbon decorations, and we can arrange rose petal service for your grand entrance and exit. We'll also have "Just Married" signs ready for your departure to the reception.

user:
Perfect! Can you also help arrange a horse‑drawn carriage for the ceremony exit?

assistant channel=analysis:
They're asking about horse-drawn carriage service, which would be an external service not mentioned in our hotel's limousine fleet offerings. This goes beyond our available transportation services.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Horse‑drawn carriage services would require coordination with external Charleston vendors. Exploring available options.

user:
Also, do you provide transportation for out‑of‑town wedding guests from the airport?

assistant channel=analysis:
They're asking about guest transportation from the airport. While we have motor coaches that can handle 20-30 guests and mention guest shuttles in our wedding services, this would be part of our comprehensive wedding coordination capabilities.

assistant channel=final:
Yes! Our luxury motor coaches can accommodate 20‑30 guests for airport pickup and guest shuttle services. We coordinate timeline management for multiple pickup locations as part of our comprehensive wedding day coordination.
