Hi there! We’re about to catch the sunset from the cliffs—so pretty here. Is Cliff & Cove still open?

Provide hours.

It is open 08:30–21:00 daily, so you’re good if you stop by before nine.

Lovely. Can we have an email receipt instead of paper if we pick up a candle?

Yes—just request an email receipt at checkout. We also support paperless receipts by default if you opt in.

We heard there’s an artisan market—can you send the full vendor catalog with price lists for this weekend?
