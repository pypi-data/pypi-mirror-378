They loved seeing the condors! We spotted several on our hike. Do you have any condor-related souvenirs?

Kids loved the condors. Should suggest condor-themed souvenirs and share interesting facts.

The California condors are such magnificent birds! It's amazing that you spotted them - they're quite rare and a real treat to see.

For condor-themed souvenirs, we have:

- **Condor Figurines**: Detailed wooden carvings of the birds in flight
- **Condor Fact Cards**: Educational cards with fun facts for kids
- **Condor T-shirts**: With beautiful illustrations of the birds
- **Condor Plush Toys**: Soft, cuddly toys that are perfect for younger kids
- **Condor Books**: Stories about condor conservation and canyon wildlife

The condor fact cards are particularly great for kids - they learn that these birds have the largest wingspan of any North American bird and can live up to 60 years!

Your kids are going to love taking a piece of the Grand Canyon home with them. The gift shop is located near the main entrance, and we're open until 8 PM.
