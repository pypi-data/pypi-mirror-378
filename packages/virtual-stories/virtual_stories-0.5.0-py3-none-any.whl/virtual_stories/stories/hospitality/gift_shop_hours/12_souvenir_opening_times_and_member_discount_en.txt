user:
Hi there! I’ve got ten minutes before my talk starts. When is the Sunrise Boutique open today?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for today’s hours. The system provides regular hours and peak-season extension rules.

assistant channel=final:
Today Sunrise Boutique is open 08:00–21:30. If it’s Fri–Sun in peak season (June–August), they extend to 22:00.

user:
Perfect. I’m Gold tier—does that actually get me anything at the shop?

assistant channel=analysis:
Gold tier discount is 10% per the system membership table.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—Gold members receive 10% off eligible items at the register. Just mention your tier or show your member QR.

user:
Nice. Also, the lobby smells amazing—kind of citrusy. Do they sell that diffuser oil there?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk plus a product query. I can acknowledge the compliment and guide them. The system doesn’t explicitly list diffuser oils, but I should avoid inventing product details. I can direct them to popular quick souvenirs and how to find the shop.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for the kind words—our garden corridor does carry a fresh citrus note! The boutique stocks quick souvenirs up front (postcards, keychains, shell bracelets, travel sunscreen). It’s lobby level—from reception, turn left toward the garden corridor and it’s on your right.

user:
If I grab a bracelet and a postcard set, can I charge it to my room and get gift wrapping?

assistant channel=analysis:
Payment and wrapping policies are specified.

assistant channel=final:
Yes. You can charge to your room with photo ID. Gift wrapping is complimentary on purchases over $30; otherwise it’s $3 per item.

user:
Could you confirm exactly which artisan makers are featured this week and set aside two shell bracelets from the rotating section?

assistant channel=analysis:
The specific artisan lineup is beyond the provided system details; also a reservation request that requires inventory confirmation. This is a case for the special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Appreciate your request for the current artisan lineup and a hold on specific pieces—this is being processed now.
