user:
Hey! We just got back from the harbor cruise—such a breeze tonight. Is Harbor Finds still open?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user needs tonight’s hours. Use system hours.

assistant channel=final:
Welcome back! Yes—on Fri–Sat they’re open until 22:00. On other days it’s 21:00 (Sun 20:00).

user:
Great timing. Also, does the shop do tax-free for travelers?

assistant channel=analysis:
System states no duty-free/tax-free onshore.

assistant channel=final:
They don’t offer duty-free. Local sales tax applies to all onshore retail purchases.

user:
No worries. Could you hold two skyline mugs while I run upstairs for my wallet?

assistant channel=analysis:
Hold policy allows complimentary 2-hour hold with receipt stub, but the guest has not purchased yet. I can clarify that holds require a receipt stub.

assistant channel=final:
They can hold items for 2 hours with a receipt stub. If you purchase now, they’ll tag and hold them while you head upstairs.

user:
We’re also collecting pins from local artisans. Could you confirm which creators are featured this week and email me high-res photos before I decide?

assistant channel=analysis:
Specific artisan lineup and photo requests aren’t in system facts and would require coordination. Use the special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for the request on this week’s artisan pins and image previews—placing this with our team now.
