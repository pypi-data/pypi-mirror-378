I'm traveling for business and have an emotional support animal. Can I bring them to the hotel?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about bringing an emotional support animal, but the system clearly states that emotional support animals are not classified as service animals under this policy. I need to explain this distinction and offer the kennel alternative.

assistant channel=final:
Under our policy, emotional support animals aren't classified as service animals. Only trained service animals that perform specific tasks for a person with a disability are permitted onsite. For your emotional support animal, our partner Harbor Paws Kennel is 0.8 km away with excellent facilities.
