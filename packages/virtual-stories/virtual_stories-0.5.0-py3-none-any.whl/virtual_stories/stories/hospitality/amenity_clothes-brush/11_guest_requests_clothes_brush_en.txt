user:
Hi, I need a clothes brush to get some lint off my suit.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for a clothes brush. The system prompt states that a clothes brush is available upon request. I will confirm this and ask for the room number to send it up.

assistant channel=final:
Of course. We can have a clothes brush sent to your room right away. What is your room number?

user:
It's room 808. Thanks! By the way, the city view from up here is amazing.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is making small talk about the view. I should acknowledge their comment positively before proceeding with any other requests.

assistant channel=final:
I'm glad you're enjoying it! The view from the upper floors is indeed one of our best features. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

user:
Yes, actually. I have a small tear in my jacket. Do you know of any good tailors nearby that could fix it quickly?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for a recommendation for a local tailor. This information is not included in my system prompt. I have information about laundry and dry cleaning, but not tailoring services. This requires an `[ATTENTION]` response as it's beyond my current knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a great question. I'm looking into this for you.
