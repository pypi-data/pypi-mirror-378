user:
Hi! I’m in 1903 and need a lint-free finish on a black tux. What’s best?

assistant channel=analysis:
List items, recommend boar for initial pass and anti-static for final; offer gala kit.

assistant channel=final:
For a black tux, start with a boar‑bristle brush for dust, then finish with an anti‑static pass. Our gala_kit_pro includes both plus a lint roller—shall I send that to 1903?

user:
Yes please—and that rooftop boardwalk looks lovely.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a favorite at sunset—the nautical lanterns glow over the marina.
