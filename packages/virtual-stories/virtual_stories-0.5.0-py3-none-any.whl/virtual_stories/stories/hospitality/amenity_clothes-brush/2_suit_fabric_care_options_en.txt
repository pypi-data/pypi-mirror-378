Hello! I’ve got a wool blazer and a silk dress to prep in room 1206. Which clothes brush should I use for each?

assistant channel=analysis:
List brush options; map wool to boar_bristle_oak and silk (delicate weave) to horsehair_beech per guidance; then offer delivery.

{"items":[{"code":"boar_bristle_oak","best_for":["wool","tweed"]},{"code":"horsehair_beech","best_for":["cashmere","silk","delicate_weaves"]},{"code":"nylon_anti_static_travel","best_for":["synthetics","blends"]},{"code":"lint_roller_refill","best_for":["lint_only"]}],"eta_minutes_range":"10-18"}

assistant channel=final:
For the wool blazer, choose the boar‑bristle brush (boar_bristle_oak). For the silk dress, a gentle horsehair brush (horsehair_beech) is best for delicate weaves. Would you like both sent to room 1206?

user:
Yes please. And the lobby smells amazing—what is that?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk reply using property profile detail.

assistant channel=final:
That’s our cedar framing near the slate fireplace—warm wood notes carry through the lobby.
