Hi! I have a cashmere sweater with some fuzz. Can I brush it, and which brush should I use? I’m in room C-405.

Yes—use a fine horsehair brush (horsehair_maple) with short, light strokes. After washing, lay flat to dry away from direct heat. Shall I send the horsehair brush to C-405?

user:
Please do. The view here is stunning.

assistant channel=final:
It is—our chalet wing faces the Glacier Run with alpine pines all around.
