I have an electric car. Do you have charging stations available?

The user is asking about our EV charging stations. I should first check the status of the stations.

assistant channel=analysis:
I have the status of the charging stations. I will inform the user of the availability.

assistant channel=final:
Yes, we do! We have three EV charging stations for our guests. It looks like two of them are currently available.

user:
Great! Can I reserve one? My name is Jane Doe, and I'll probably need it for about 3 hours. It's so convenient that you offer this service!

assistant channel=analysis:
The user wants to reserve a charging station for 3 hours. I will use the `reserve_ev_charging_station` tool to make the reservation and also respond to their comment.

assistant channel=analysis:
The reservation has been made. I will now inform the user.

assistant channel=final:
We're happy to offer it! I've just reserved charging station 1 for you for the next 3 hours, Ms. Doe. You can find the charging stations in our underground parking garage on level P1. Please let us know if you need any assistance.
