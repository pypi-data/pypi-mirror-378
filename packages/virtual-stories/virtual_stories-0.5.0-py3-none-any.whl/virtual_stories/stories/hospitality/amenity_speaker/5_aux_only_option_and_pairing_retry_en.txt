I might just use AUX in 1420—can you help?

Check audio status to confirm name, then arrange AUX cable.

assistant channel=final:
We can do that—AUX cable is on its way to 1420 (AUX-1420-8810), arriving in about 9 minutes. If you decide to pair later, look for “CVH-ROOM-1420”.

user:
What’s the evening lobby playlist called?

user:
Can you increase the speaker’s bass remotely?
