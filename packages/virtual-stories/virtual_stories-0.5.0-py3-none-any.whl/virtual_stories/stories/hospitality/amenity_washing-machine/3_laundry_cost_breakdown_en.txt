I need to do some laundry but I'm watching my budget. Can you give me the exact costs for everything?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants detailed pricing information. I should use the pricing tool to get accurate current rates and then provide a comprehensive breakdown.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_pricing_details:
{"service_type": "standard_wash"}

tool.get_pricing_details channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"standard_wash": 4.50, "dry_only": 3.50, "express_wash": 7.50, "wash_dry_combo": 7.00, "pressing": 15.00, "discount_eligible": true}

assistant channel=analysis:
I have the pricing details. I should provide a clear breakdown and mention the available payment options and perks.

assistant channel=final:
Here's our current laundry pricing: Standard wash is $4.50, drying is $3.50, or you can get a wash-dry combo for $7.00. Express service (faster cycles) is $7.50. We accept cash, credit cards, room charge, or digital wallets like Apple Pay.

user:
The combo sounds like a good deal. Do you have any discounts or freebies?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about discounts and perks, which is information available in our system prompt. I can answer this directly.

assistant channel=final:
Yes! As a guest, you get free detergent for your first wash. If you're staying multiple nights, there's a 10% discount on laundry services. We also have a loyalty program where you earn points on laundry charges that can be redeemed for room upgrades.

user:
That's helpful. What about payment - can I put it on my room bill?

assistant channel=analysis:
Payment options are detailed in the system information. I can explain the room charge option and other alternatives available.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! You can charge it to your room bill, pay with cash or credit card at the machines, or use digital wallets. The machines have card readers and we have a change machine if you need coins. All payments are processed securely.

user:
Great. One more thing - I have a delicate silk blouse. Is there a better option than the regular machines?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about delicate items, which requires information beyond our basic laundry services. This falls under professional services not covered by our tools.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Looking into delicate garment care options for you.

user:
Thanks. By the way, I love how you use biodegradable detergents - very environmentally conscious!

assistant channel=analysis:
