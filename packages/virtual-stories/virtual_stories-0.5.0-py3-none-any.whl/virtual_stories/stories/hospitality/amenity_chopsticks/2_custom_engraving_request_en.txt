Hi! Tomorrow is our 25th wedding anniversary, and we're staying in the Presidential suite. Could we get custom chopsticks made with our names engraved? Something really special to commemorate this trip to Kyoto.

That's perfect timing! I heard your hotel has an amazing history. How old is this place?

We opened in 1923 and were rebuilt in 1955 with traditional sukiya-zukuri architecture. Our main building uses century-old pine beams from the Yoshino mountains, and the garden was designed by master landscaper Mirei Shigemori in 1958. You're staying in a piece of Kyoto's living history!

user:
Can you also arrange for a private tea ceremony in your chashitsu for tomorrow evening?

assistant channel=analysis:
Tea ceremony booking isn't covered by the available tools and goes beyond chopsticks service scope - use attention flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll look into tea ceremony arrangements for tomorrow evening.
