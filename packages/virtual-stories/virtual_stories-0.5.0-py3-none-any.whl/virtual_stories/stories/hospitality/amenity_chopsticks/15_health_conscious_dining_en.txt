Great! Also, do you offer yoga classes that focus on mindful eating?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about yoga classes focused on mindful eating. While we have yoga classes and mindful eating practices mentioned separately, we don't have specific "mindful eating yoga" classes detailed in our current knowledge. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

While you check that, could you tell me about your spa treatments using botanical ingredients?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about our spa treatments using local botanical ingredients, which is detailed in our exclusive wellness features. I should provide comprehensive information about the treatments, ingredients used, and booking options.

Our spa treatments are designed with local botanical ingredients from the Rocky Mountains! We use ingredients like arnica for muscle relief, yarrow for skin health, and pine extracts for respiratory wellness. Treatments include botanical wraps, herbal massages, and essential oil therapies.

Sessions are available in our wellness pavilion overlooking the mountains, and we can customize treatments based on your wellness goals. Would you like to book a session to complement your consultation?
