Hello! I'm interested in experiencing authentic Asian dining. Could you tell me about your traditional chopsticks and cultural dining options?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants authentic Asian dining experience with traditional chopsticks. I need to highlight our cultural dining amenities, traditional collections, and premium sets. I should provide cultural context and educational elements.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful! Our Golden Pagoda offers an authentic cultural dining experience. We have traditional chopsticks in bamboo, ebony, rosewood, and silver varieties - all handcrafted by artisans using sustainable materials and traditional techniques.

Each set comes with cultural education about proper etiquette, regional customs, and food symbolism. Our premium collections include engraved motifs and ceremonial presentation boxes.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about our tea ceremony experiences, which is one of our exclusive cultural features. This is fully within our system knowledge and I should provide comprehensive details about the program and booking options.

assistant channel=final:
Our tea ceremony experiences are led by master instructors in our traditional tatami room! Sessions last 45 minutes and include the complete ceremony: matcha preparation, proper serving techniques, and mindfulness meditation.

We can arrange this as a private session or group experience, and it beautifully complements our cultural dining. The ceremonies use authentic utensils and follow centuries-old traditions.

user:
That sounds perfect! Could you arrange a tea ceremony and traditional chopsticks for our room?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants both the tea ceremony and traditional chopsticks arranged. I should coordinate both services and provide details about timing and preparation.

assistant channel=final:
I'd be delighted to arrange both! For the tea ceremony, we have availability tomorrow at 4 PM in our tatami room. We'll also deliver a complete traditional chopsticks set to your room - I recommend the bamboo variety for its warmth and cultural authenticity.

The set will arrive within 15 minutes, and we'll include educational materials about proper usage and cultural significance.

user:
Excellent! While we're on the topic of culture, do you offer martial arts training?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about martial arts training, which is listed in our exclusive cultural features. I should provide details about the program, styles offered, and age-appropriate options.

assistant channel=final:
Yes, we offer martial arts training with certified instructors! Our programs include traditional karate, tai chi, and self-defense techniques. Classes are available for all ages, from children's introductory sessions to advanced adult training.

Sessions run for 60 minutes and emphasize discipline, respect, and physical wellness. We can schedule around your tea ceremony if you'd like to combine cultural experiences.

user:
Actually, I'm more interested in the tea varieties you mentioned. What rare varieties do you have?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about rare tea varieties, which is part of our tea tasting experiences in the exclusive features. However, specific varieties aren't detailed in our current knowledge base. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag as it's beyond our defined scope.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I appreciate your interest in our rare tea varieties. Checking our current selection.
