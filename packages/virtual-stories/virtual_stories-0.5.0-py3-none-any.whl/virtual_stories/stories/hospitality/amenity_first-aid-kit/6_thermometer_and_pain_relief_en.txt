Could I get a thermometer and some pain relief tablets to room 1506?

Absolutely—thermometer (with single-use covers) and standard-dosage pain relief tablets are on their way to room 1506. ETA ~12 minutes (fd-team, ticket CVH-1506-TP).

Is there a rooftop here?

Answer from First Aid Desk extras.

Yes—there’s a rooftop deck with monument views.

That sounds nice.

Chitchat.

It’s a peaceful place to unwind when you’re feeling better.

Can you provide medical advice on dosage timing for me?

Medical advice beyond inventory is out of scope—use ATTENTION.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I can’t advise on dosage timing; I’ll check appropriate guidance options for you.
