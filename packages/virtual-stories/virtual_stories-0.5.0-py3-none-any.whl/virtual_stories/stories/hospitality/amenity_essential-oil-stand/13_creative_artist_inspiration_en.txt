That sounds wonderful! I'll definitely try the Creative Inspiration blend. By the way, I've heard about your art history lectures. Can you tell me which Renaissance masters are typically covered?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the Renaissance masters covered in art history lectures. Our system information mentions daily art history lectures covering Renaissance masters, but it doesn't specify which particular masters or artists are included in the lectures. This goes beyond the basic description available in our context.

Thanks! I'm also interested in your creative coaching sessions. What kind of techniques do the coaches use to help with creative blocks?

Our system information mentions creative coaching sessions that help artists overcome blocks, but it doesn't provide specific details about the techniques or methodologies used.
