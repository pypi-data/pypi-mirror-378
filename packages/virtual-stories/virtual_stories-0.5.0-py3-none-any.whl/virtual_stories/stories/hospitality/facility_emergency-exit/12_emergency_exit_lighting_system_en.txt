Hi! I'm concerned about what happens during a power outage. Do your emergency exits have backup lighting?

According to the system prompt, emergency lighting systems provide 90 minutes of backup power with LED illumination meeting ADA standards for brightness and contrast. We also have backup power systems that ensure emergency lighting and door mechanisms function during power outages.

Absolutely! Our emergency lighting systems provide 90 minutes of backup power with LED illumination that meets ADA standards for brightness and contrast. Our backup power systems ensure emergency lighting and door mechanisms function during power outages.

user:
That's very reassuring! What type of lighting do you use for emergencies?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the type of emergency lighting we use. According to the system prompt, we use LED illumination for emergency lighting. This information is available in the system context.

assistant channel=final:
We use LED illumination for our emergency lighting systems. LED lights are energy-efficient, long-lasting, and provide excellent visibility during emergencies.

user:
Perfect! Are the emergency exit signs also illuminated?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about illumination of emergency exit signs. According to the system prompt, emergency exit signage uses high-contrast colors (red on white background) with large, clear fonts and universal symbols. However, I don't have specific information about whether the signs themselves are illuminated or just use high-contrast colors. This goes beyond the available system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a great question about emergency exit sign illumination. Checking available options.

user:
I understand. How often do you test the emergency lighting systems?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about testing frequency for emergency lighting systems. This information is not provided in the system prompt. While I know about our backup power systems and LED illumination, I don't have specific information about testing schedules or maintenance procedures for the emergency lighting. This goes beyond the available system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's an important question about emergency lighting testing. Reviewing available resources.

user:
That's okay. I appreciate you explaining what you can about the backup power and lighting systems.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is positive feedback about our emergency lighting information. I should acknowledge their appreciation and maybe add a brief comment about our commitment to guest safety.
