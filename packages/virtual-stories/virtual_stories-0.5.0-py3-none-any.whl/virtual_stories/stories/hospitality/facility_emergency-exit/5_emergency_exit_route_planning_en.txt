I'm staying on the 15th floor and I like to be prepared. Could you tell me the emergency exit routes from my floor, the restaurant, and the spa?

I have comprehensive exit information for all three locations. I'll provide clear, organized information about each route.

assistant channel=final:
Great planning! Here are your emergency exit routes: From the 15th floor, use Stairwell B (east side, 30 feet from elevators). From the restaurant on the 2nd floor, use Stairwell A (north side, through main dining area). From the spa on the 3rd floor, use Stairwell C (south side, near relaxation lounge). All routes lead to the assembly point in parking garage level B2.
