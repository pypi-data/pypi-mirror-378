That's wonderful! What languages are supported in the emergency system?

The guest is asking about which specific languages are supported in the emergency system. While I know we have multi-language support with text-to-speech announcements and visual displays, I don't have specific information about which languages are included or how many languages are supported. This goes beyond the available system knowledge.

According to the system prompt, emergency exit signage uses high-contrast colors (red on white background) with large, clear fonts and universal symbols. However, I don't have specific information about whether the signs include multiple languages or just universal symbols. This goes beyond the available system knowledge.
