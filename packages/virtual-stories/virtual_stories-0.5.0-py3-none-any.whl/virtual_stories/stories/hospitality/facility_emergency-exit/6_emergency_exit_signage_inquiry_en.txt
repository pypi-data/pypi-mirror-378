I notice the emergency exit signs have a specific design. What do the symbols mean and are they standardized?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about emergency exit signage standards and symbols. I can provide this information from the system knowledge about signage standards.

assistant channel=final:
The emergency exit signs follow international standards! The green "EXIT" text with the running man symbol is part of the ISO 3864 standard for emergency symbols. The running man represents "escape route" and is universally recognized. Our signs are LED illuminated with 24-hour battery backup, placed 6-8 feet high for optimal visibility, and include Braille for accessibility. They meet NYC Fire Department codes and ADA compliance requirements.
