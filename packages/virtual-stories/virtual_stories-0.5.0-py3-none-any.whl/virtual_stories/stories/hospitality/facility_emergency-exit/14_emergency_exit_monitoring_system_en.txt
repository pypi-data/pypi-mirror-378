Hi! I'm curious about your emergency exit security. Are the exits monitored?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about emergency exit monitoring and security. According to the system prompt, all emergency exits are monitored 24/7 with security cameras and automatic door status sensors. This information is available in the system context.

assistant channel=final:
Yes! All our emergency exits are monitored 24/7 with security cameras and automatic door status sensors. This ensures we can respond immediately to any issues and maintain the security of our emergency systems.

user:
That's very reassuring! What happens if someone tries to use an emergency exit inappropriately?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about inappropriate use of emergency exits. While I know we have 24/7 monitoring with security cameras and automatic door status sensors, I don't have specific information about what happens when someone uses an emergency exit inappropriately or what our response procedures are. This goes beyond the available system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's an important question about emergency exit security protocols. Checking available options.

user:
I understand. Are the emergency exits always unlocked for safety?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about whether emergency exits are always unlocked for safety. This information is not provided in the system prompt. While I know about our monitoring systems and door status sensors, I don't have specific information about the locking mechanism or whether exits are always unlocked. This goes beyond the available system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a great question about emergency exit locking mechanisms. Reviewing available resources.

user:
That's okay. Do you have any special alarms or alerts if an emergency exit is opened?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about alarms or alerts when emergency exits are opened. While I know we have automatic door status sensors and 24/7 monitoring, I don't have specific information about alarms or alert systems when exits are opened. This goes beyond the available system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's an excellent question about emergency exit alert systems. Checking available options.
