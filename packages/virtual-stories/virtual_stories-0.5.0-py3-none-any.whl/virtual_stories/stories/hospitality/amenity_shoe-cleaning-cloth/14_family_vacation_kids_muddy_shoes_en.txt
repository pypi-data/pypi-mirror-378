Hi there! We just got back from the nature trail with our two kids and everyone's shoes are absolutely covered in mud. Could we get some cleaning cloths sent to our family suite? The kids had such a blast but we made quite a mess!

Family needs cleaning cloths after outdoor adventure. Should provide cloths and mention the complimentary muddy shoe cleaning station and boot dryers available for family suites.

What a wonderful adventure day! I'll send up several heavy-duty cleaning cloths to your family suite right away. For future trail adventures, we also have a complimentary muddy shoe cleaning station right near the main entrance that families love using, plus your suite includes professional boot dryers to help get everyone's footwear ready for tomorrow's fun.

That's fantastic they enjoyed the wildlife! Tomorrow you might love our Junior Ranger certification program for ages 6-12, and this evening at 19:00 we have storytelling around the outdoor fire pit. Tonight there's also a family movie screening in our theater, and if the weather's clear, we offer stargazing sessions with our professional telescopeâ€”perfect for young adventurers who loved spotting animals today!
