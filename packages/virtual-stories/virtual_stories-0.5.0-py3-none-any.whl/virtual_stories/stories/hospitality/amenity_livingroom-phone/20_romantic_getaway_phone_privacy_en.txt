Hi! We're celebrating our anniversary in Romance Suite 3209. Can you help us set up the living room phone so we won't be disturbed during our romantic dinner? We want complete privacy.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is a couple celebrating their anniversary and needs privacy settings. The system mentions privacy mode, do-not-disturb mode, and discretion protocols. I should provide information about these privacy features and how to activate them.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations on your anniversary! Our Romance Suite phones are designed with complete privacy in mind. You can activate privacy mode by pressing the menu button and selecting "Intimate Settings." This will enable do-not-disturb mode, silent notifications, and private call screening. The phone also integrates with the romantic lighting system for intimate ambiance. Would you like me to arrange for our romance concierge to come up and set up all the privacy features, plus coordinate your romantic dinner?

Do you have any recommendations for local romantic restaurants or private dining experiences that offer special anniversary packages?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for local romantic restaurant recommendations with anniversary packages, which goes beyond the hotel's internal phone system and requires external dining service information not available in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research local romantic restaurants and private dining experiences with special anniversary packages.
