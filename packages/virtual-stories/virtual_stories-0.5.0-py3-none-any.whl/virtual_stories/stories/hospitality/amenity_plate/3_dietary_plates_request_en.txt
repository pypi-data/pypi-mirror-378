Hello! I'm in room 812 and I have multiple food allergies that require strict meal separation. I just ordered room service but need specialized plates to prevent cross-contamination. Do you have compartmented plates available?

We also have color-coded utensils for different food types. Would you like me to send a couple to your room?

user:
Yes, please send two. I'm allergic to nuts, dairy, and gluten. Your nutritional analysis service sounds helpful.

user:
Very impressive! Do you know of any local restaurants that specialize in allergen-free or specialized diet cuisine?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about local restaurants specializing in allergen-free cuisine, which goes beyond our hotel's dietary services and requires external information about local dining options.

We provide comprehensive in-house dietary support and accommodations.

[ATTENTION] I'll look into local restaurants specializing in allergen-free cuisine.
