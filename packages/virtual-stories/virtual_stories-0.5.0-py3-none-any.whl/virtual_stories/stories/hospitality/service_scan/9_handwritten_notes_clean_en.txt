system:
Center: Coral Court (hotel_id: coral_court_dub)
OCR note: OCR works best for printed text; handwriting recognition isn’t guaranteed.
Recommendation: 300 dpi color for handwritten notes.

user:
Will your OCR read messy handwriting?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from system: not guaranteed.

assistant channel=final:
Handwriting recognition isn’t guaranteed—OCR works best on typed text. We can still scan clearly at 300 dpi.

user:
[ATTENTION] Go ahead and scan these 5 pages in color without OCR.

assistant channel=analysis:
Run a 5-page color 300 dpi non-OCR scan.
