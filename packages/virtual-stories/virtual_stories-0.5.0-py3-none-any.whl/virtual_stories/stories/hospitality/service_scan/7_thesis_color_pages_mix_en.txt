Limits: up to 50 pages per job; for larger, split into batches.
Pricing: b&w €0.20/page; color €0.40/page.
Recommendation: 300 dpi; OCR available.

user:
I have a 40-page thesis with 6 color pages—can you scan it with OCR?

assistant channel=analysis:
Yes—fits within 50-page limit; explain batches if larger. Offer an approximate quote by color rate for 40 pages all color to stay within rule; or better, provide two quotes: but tool only accepts one color param; we’ll quote color as upper-bound.

assistant channel=commentary to=quote_scan_job:
{"pages":40,"color":"color"}

tool.quote_scan_job:
{"currency":"EUR","per_page":0.40,"pages":40,"total":16.0}

assistant channel=final:
We can scan all 40 pages with OCR. As an upper-bound, scanning at the color rate would be €16.00; b&w pages are cheaper (€0.20/page).

user:
[ATTENTION] Roughly how long would 40 pages take right now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use estimate_turnaround with pages=40 to avoid guessing.

assistant channel=commentary to=estimate_turnaround:
{"pages":40}

tool.estimate_turnaround:
{"minutes": 12}

assistant channel=final:
About 12 minutes for a 40-page job at 300 dpi with OCR.
