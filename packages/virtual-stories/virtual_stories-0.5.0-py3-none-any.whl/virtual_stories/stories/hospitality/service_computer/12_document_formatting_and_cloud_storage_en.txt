The lobby location is perfect - easy to grab coffee between work sessions.

assistant channel=final:
Exactly! Being on the ground floor next to the lobby makes it convenient for breaks and refreshments.

user:
Can you help me format this proposal to match my company's branding guidelines?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for help with company-specific branding guidelines. While I have information about general formatting support and templates, I don't have access to their specific company branding guidelines, which would be beyond the scope of standard business center services.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Company-specific branding guidelines aren't available in our standard resources. Reviewing available options.
