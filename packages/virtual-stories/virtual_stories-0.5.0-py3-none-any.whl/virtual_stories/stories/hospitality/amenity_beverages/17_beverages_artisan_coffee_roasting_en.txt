Perfect! Since we roast fresh batches at 6:00 AM and 2:00 PM daily, I'd recommend our medium roast (Full City) from Guatemala - it's excellent for the high altitude and has wonderful chocolate notes. Fresh-roasted coffee is delivered within 2 hours of roasting for maximum flavor. What grind would you prefer - whole bean, coarse for French press, medium for drip, or fine for espresso?
