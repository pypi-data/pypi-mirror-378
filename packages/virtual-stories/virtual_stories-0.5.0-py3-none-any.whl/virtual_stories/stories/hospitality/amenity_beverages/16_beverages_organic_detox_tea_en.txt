你好！我最近在進行身體排毒，想問問你們有沒有有機的排毒茶可以選擇？

您好！我們提供多種優質有機排毒茶選擇。包括綠茶配檸檬草、蒲公英根排毒混合茶、薑黃薑茶、洋甘菊薰衣草舒緩茶，以及薄荷助消化茶。所有有機茶都來自科羅拉多州和太平洋西北地區的認證有機農場。請問您想了解哪一種，以及您的房號是多少？

很好的選擇！薑黃薑茶確實對身體很有益處，特別是在高海拔地區有助於身體適應和自然排毒。您的薑黃薑茶將在12分鐘內送到2847號房。我們會附上有機蜂蜜和新鮮檸檬片。送餐費用是8美元，會加到您的房帳上。

user:
太好了！順便問一下，你們的茶葉是怎麼沖泡的？有什麼特別的建議嗎？

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest asks about brewing instructions and recommendations for the tea. This information is available in the system prompt about steeping instructions.

assistant channel=final:
我們的建議是沖泡3-5分鐘以獲得最佳風味和抗氧化成分釋放。水溫建議在85-90度左右，不要用沸水以免破壞茶葉的營養成分。薑黃薑茶特別適合在飯後飲用，有助於消化和吸收。

user:
謝謝你的建議！對了，我想問問你們有沒有其他有機的飲品選擇？

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest asks about other organic beverage options. This goes beyond the specific organic detox tea information provided in the system prompt, so I should use the special flag.
