The Sauvignon Blanc provides bright, refreshing character with citrus and herb notes. Each variety reflects the unique terroir of Napa Valley, with optimal growing conditions, soil composition, and climate that create distinctive flavor profiles and exceptional quality!

The wine tasting process is a beautiful art! Our certified sommeliers guide you through the proper evaluation technique, starting with visual examination of color and clarity, then olfactory assessment of aromas and bouquet, followed by taste evaluation of flavor, body, acidity, tannins, and finish. We provide professional wine glasses for optimal tasting, and our wine education workshops cover proper techniques, regional characteristics, and aging potential. The Cabernet Sauvignon will show deep ruby color, complex aromas of blackcurrant and cedar, full body with structured tannins, and a long, elegant finish!
