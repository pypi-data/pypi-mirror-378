That's incredible! I'm particularly interested in the Japanese teas. Can you tell me about the different varieties and their unique characteristics?

Guest asking about Japanese tea varieties and characteristics. I have information about matcha, sencha, gyokuro, and their specific flavor profiles and preparation methods in the system context.

The Japanese teas are truly exceptional! Matcha is ceremonial grade with vibrant green color and umami flavor, perfect for traditional tea ceremony. Sencha is steamed green tea with fresh, grassy notes and bright acidity, ideal for daily enjoyment. Gyokuro is shade-grown green tea with sweet, delicate flavor and premium quality. Each variety has its own optimal brewing temperature and steeping time - matcha requires whisking with hot water, sencha needs precise temperature control, and gyokuro benefits from gentle brewing to preserve its delicate character!

The traditional Japanese tea ceremony is a beautiful art form! We have certified tea masters who perform the ceremony with authentic utensils and techniques. The ceremony includes precise movements, traditional tea bowls, bamboo whisks, and ceremonial grade matcha. The process involves warming the bowl, whisking the matcha to create a frothy consistency, and presenting it with traditional etiquette. We also offer tea ceremony workshops where you can learn the techniques yourself, and our traditional tea house features authentic Japanese architecture for the complete cultural experience!
