Good afternoon! Welcome to The Culinary Arts Hotel! We're absolutely delighted to have a professional bakery chef among our guests.

That sounds perfect! I'm particularly interested in the muscovado sugar. What's the molasses content like?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the molasses content of muscovado sugar. From our system prompt, I know we have muscovado sugar with rich molasses flavor, and I should provide details about its characteristics for professional use.

assistant channel=final:
Our muscovado sugar has an exceptionally rich molasses flavor with approximately 6-8% molasses content, giving it that deep, complex sweetness perfect for professional baking. It's unrefined and retains all the natural minerals and flavors from the sugarcane. The texture is slightly moist and sticky, which makes it ideal for creating rich, caramelized flavors in your desserts. It's sourced from small-batch producers who specialize in traditional processing methods.
