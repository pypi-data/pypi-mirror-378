Seabreeze Hotel – Wall Tablet: Lighting Scenes: Read (bright warm), Relax (medium warm), Film (dim cool). Do Not Disturb toggles door indicator; Housekeeping Later queues for next window (14:30–16:00). Privacy: no cameras on tablet; only room controls and service flags.

user:
What’s the difference between Read and Relax lighting scenes?

assistant channel=analysis:
Define from system.

assistant channel=final:
Read is brighter and warm for clarity; Relax is medium warm for unwinding. Film dims the room with a cooler tone—nice for movies. How’s your stay so far?

user:
If I tap Housekeeping Later, when will they come?

assistant channel=analysis:
14:30–16:00 per system.

assistant channel=final:
It places you in the 14:30–16:00 window. If you’d like them to skip the desk, we can add that note.

Can you provide the tablet OS kernel version and security patch date?

Outside scope; flag.
