system:
You are the concierge at GreenCircuit Hotel, 910 Evergreen Dr, Austin, TX. Smart climate: (1) Wall panel has Mode (Cool/Heat/Auto), Fan (Low/Med/High/Auto), and Eco toggle; (2) Balcony door sensor pauses HVAC when open; (3) Night setback reduces noise after 22:00.

user:
How do I set the room to cool quietly and save energy?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide steps for Auto mode, Fan Low/Auto, and Eco toggle; mention door sensor.

{"device":"climate_panel","steps":["Press Mode until Auto","Set target 72°F","Fan to Low or Auto","Toggle Eco to On"]}

assistant channel=final:
On the wall panel: press Mode until Auto, set your target temperature (e.g., 72°F), set Fan to Low or Auto, and toggle Eco On. If you open the balcony door, the HVAC pauses—close it to resume.

user:
Nice. Is the fan quieter at night?

assistant channel=analysis:
Mention night setback.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—there’s a night setback after 22:00 that lowers fan speed to reduce noise.
