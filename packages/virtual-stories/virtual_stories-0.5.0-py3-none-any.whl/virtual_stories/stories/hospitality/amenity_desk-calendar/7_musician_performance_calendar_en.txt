Hello! I'm violinist Elena Rodriguez in Performance Suite 1906. I'm on tour with the city symphony and need a desk calendar to organize my concert schedule and rehearsal times. Do you have anything designed for musicians?

assistant channel=analysis:
The violinist in Performance Suite 1906 needs a musician's desk calendar for concert and rehearsal planning. This matches our performance amenities perfectly. I can use the order_performance_amenity tool with musical features.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.order_performance_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "Musician's Desk Calendar", "room_number": "1906", "performance_features": ["Concert Scheduling", "Rehearsal Tracking", "Performance Notes"]}

tool.order_performance_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "confirmed", "delivery_time": "15 minutes", "message": "Musician's desk calendar with concert scheduling and rehearsal tracking is being prepared for Performance Suite 1906."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The performance amenity order was successful. I should mention our music practice studios and performance spaces since this guest is a touring violinist, as these are available in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect for your symphony tour! I've ordered our musician's desk calendar with concert scheduling templates and rehearsal tracking sections for your suite. It will arrive in about 15 minutes. You might also appreciate our soundproof practice studios and performance hall for your violin preparations.

That sounds wonderful! I always appreciate hotels that understand musicians' needs. By the way, I've been traveling a lot lately. What's the most unique local attraction I should visit while I'm here?

assistant channel=analysis:
The musician is asking about unique local attractions, which is chitchat/small talk. The system prompt mentions proximity to major concert venues but doesn't provide specific information about local attractions or tourist recommendations. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you'd like to explore some unique local attractions. Let me find some special recommendations for you.

user:
Actually, let me ask about something else. Can you tell me about the instrument maintenance kit you mentioned? I'm traveling with my Stradivarius and want to ensure it stays in perfect condition.

assistant channel=analysis:
The violinist is asking about the instrument maintenance kit, which is mentioned in the system prompt as a performance amenity. I can provide details about this service without needing tools.

assistant channel=final:
Our professional instrument maintenance kit includes humidifiers for wood instruments, polishing cloths, rosin, fine tuners, bridge adjustments tools, and cleaning supplies specifically formulated for string instruments. Our luthier consultant is available for assessments and minor repairs, and we provide secure storage in climate-controlled vaults.

user:
Impressive! One more question - are there any upcoming chamber music events or collaborations I could participate in during my stay?

assistant channel=analysis:
The violinist is asking about upcoming chamber music events. The system prompt mentions collaborative jam sessions and musical events but doesn't provide specific schedules or details about chamber music events. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'd be delighted to help you find chamber music collaboration opportunities. Let me check our current musical event schedule for you.
