That's fantastic! I'm also wondering about transportation options for reaching remote research sites. What kind of services do you offer?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about transportation services for remote research sites. Our system information mentions transportation services including boat charters, helicopter rentals, and guided expeditions, but it doesn't provide specific details about availability, costs, or booking procedures. This goes beyond the basic service listing in our context.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll look into our transportation services and options for remote research sites.

user:
One more question - I need to arrange for data backup during my stay. Can you tell me about your data backup systems?

assistant channel=analysis:
