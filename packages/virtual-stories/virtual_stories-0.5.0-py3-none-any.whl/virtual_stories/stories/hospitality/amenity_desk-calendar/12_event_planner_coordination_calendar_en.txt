Hi, I'm coordinating three weddings here over the next month and really need a good calendar system to keep everything organized. Do you provide any desk calendars for event planners?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is an event planner coordinating multiple weddings and needs calendar organization tools. Our hotel provides complimentary desk calendars specifically for event planners, and since they're coordinating multiple events over a month, this definitely qualifies them for our specialized event planning calendars. I should highlight the options most suitable for managing multiple concurrent events.

assistant channel=final:
Certainly! As an event planner coordinating multiple weddings, you're welcome to our complimentary Event Planning Calendar collection. We have specialized options including the Multi-Event Coordinator for tracking concurrent events, Event Timeline Scheduler with color-coded phases, and Wedding Planning Calendar with vendor checklists. The Multi-Event Coordinator would be perfect for managing three weddings simultaneously.

The Multi-Event Coordinator sounds exactly what I need. I'll take that one. By the way, I've heard your hotel has beautiful gardens - are they available for outdoor wedding ceremonies?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the hotel's gardens for outdoor wedding ceremonies. According to our system information, we have a Terrace event space and partnerships with local wedding vendors, but we don't have specific details about garden availability for ceremonies. This goes beyond the basic event space information provided in our context, so I should use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll check the availability of our gardens for outdoor wedding ceremonies.

user:
Great, thanks. One more question - I need to arrange transportation for my wedding party from the airport. Can you recommend some reliable services?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about transportation services from the airport. Our system information mentions that we maintain partnerships with local transportation services and offer concierge services including transportation booking, but it doesn't provide specific recommendations or details about airport transfers. This requires more detailed information than what's available in our basic system context.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll look into reliable airport transportation options for your wedding party.

user:
Before I go, I noticed you have monthly wedding planning seminars. Could you tell me what topics are typically covered in these seminars?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the content of our monthly wedding planning seminars. Our system mentions that we host monthly wedding planning seminars for engaged couples, but it doesn't provide specific topics or detailed curriculum information. This goes beyond the basic description available in our context.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll gather information about the topics covered in our wedding planning seminars.

user:
Actually, let me ask something simpler - what time does your restaurant serve dinner?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about restaurant dinner hours. Our system information mentions that the hotel's restaurant offers French cuisine and international menus, but it doesn't specify operating hours. This is basic information that should be available but isn't detailed in our current context.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Let me check the dinner service hours for our restaurant.
