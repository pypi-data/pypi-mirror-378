Bonjour! I'm Chef Michel Dubois in Culinary Suite 1403. I'm here for a gastronomic festival and need a desk calendar to organize my menu demonstrations and kitchen visits. Do you have anything specifically for chefs?

That's perfect for organizing my festival schedule. I love how this hotel understands the culinary world. By the way, I've noticed the beautiful herb gardens on the balconies. What's the secret to maintaining such vibrant herbs year-round?

assistant channel=analysis:
Chef Dubois is asking about herb garden maintenance, which is chitchat/small talk about our culinary facilities. The system prompt mentions herb gardens on balconies but doesn't provide specific maintenance secrets or techniques. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I appreciate your interest in our herb gardens. Let me find out about our maintenance techniques for you.

user:
Actually, let me ask about the farmers market excursions. I'd love to source some local ingredients for my demonstrations. When are they scheduled?

assistant channel=analysis:
Chef Dubois is asking about farmers market excursion schedules. The system prompt mentions farmers market excursions as a feature but doesn't provide specific scheduling information. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

user:
Let me try a different question. Can you tell me about the wine tasting events? I'm particularly interested in pairing recommendations for French cuisine.
