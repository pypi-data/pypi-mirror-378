Hello! I'm Captain James Mitchell in Flight Suite 3102. I'm on a multi-day layover and need a desk calendar to organize my flight schedule and crew meetings. Do you have anything designed for pilots?

assistant channel=analysis:
Captain Mitchell in Flight Suite 3102 needs a pilot's desk calendar for flight scheduling and crew coordination. This matches our aviation amenities perfectly. I can use the order_aviation_amenity tool with pilot-specific features.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.order_aviation_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "Pilot's Desk Calendar", "room_number": "3102", "aviation_features": ["Flight Scheduling", "Crew Coordination", "Duty Time Tracking"]}

tool.order_aviation_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "confirmed", "delivery_time": "10 minutes", "message": "Pilot's desk calendar with flight scheduling and crew coordination is being prepared for Flight Suite 3102."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The aviation amenity order was successful. I should mention our jet lag recovery services and airport shuttle since this guest is a pilot on layover, as these are available in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely, Captain. I've ordered our pilot's desk calendar with flight scheduling templates and crew coordination sections for your suite. It will arrive in about 10 minutes. You might also find our jet lag recovery programs and airport shuttle service helpful during your layover.

user:
Thank you. I've been flying international routes a lot lately. The jet lag can be challenging. What's your most effective jet lag recovery tip?

assistant channel=analysis:
Captain Mitchell is asking about jet lag recovery tips, which is chitchat/small talk about travel health. The system prompt mentions jet lag recovery programs but doesn't provide specific tips or techniques. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand jet lag can be challenging for frequent flyers. Let me check our most effective recovery recommendations for you.

user:
Actually, let me ask about the aviation weather briefing station. I need to check some weather patterns for my next flight route.

assistant channel=analysis:
Captain Mitchell is asking about the aviation weather briefing station, which is mentioned in the system prompt as an aviation amenity. I can provide information about this service without needing tools.

assistant channel=final:
Our aviation weather briefing station provides real-time weather data, satellite imagery, and flight planning tools specifically designed for pilots. The station includes access to aviation weather services, route planning software, and NOTAM information. It's available 24/7 and can be accessed from your suite's terminal.

user:
Excellent. One more thing - I'm coordinating with my co-pilot for tomorrow's flight. Are there any meeting rooms available that are soundproof for confidential crew discussions?

assistant channel=analysis:
Captain Mitchell is asking about soundproof meeting rooms for crew discussions. The system prompt mentions crew rest areas but doesn't specify soundproof meeting rooms or their availability. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you need a soundproof space for crew coordination. Let me check the availability of our meeting facilities for you.
