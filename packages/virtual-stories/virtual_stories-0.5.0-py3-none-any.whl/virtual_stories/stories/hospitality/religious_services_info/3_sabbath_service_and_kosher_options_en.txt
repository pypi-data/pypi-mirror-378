Hi, I'm observing Shabbat this weekend. Do you have a place to pray and any kosher dining options?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm on-property reflection room hours and outline kosher handling and Shabbat key. Offer nearby synagogue info.

assistant channel=final:
Welcome, and Shabbat Shalom. We offer a Quiet Reflection Room on Level 2 open 06:00–22:00 daily. For kosher dining, we can store sealed certified meals in our Lobby Pantry’s dedicated mini-fridge and warm them double-wrapped in our supervised convection oven. We also provide a mechanical Shabbat key. Would you like details on nearby synagogues as well?

user:
Yes please—prefer something within a few kilometers, and also, can I light candles?

assistant channel=analysis:
Share terrace candle lighting policy and find nearby synagogues within 5 km.

Two nearby options: Temple Beth Seabright (1.8 km, walkable) and Chabad by the Coast (3.9 km). About candles: we allow tea lights or Shabbat candles only on the Level 2 terrace Friday 18:00–20:00 under staff supervision. Would you like me to secure a mechanical key and note the kosher heating request?

user:
That would be great. Also, do you accommodate late checkout on Saturday?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm late checkout policy and place kitchen request.

assistant channel=final:
I’ve submitted the kosher-handling note (request ID kitchen_4821). We can offer late checkout on Saturdays up to 14:00 based on availability—shall I tentatively request that and arrange a mechanical key for your arrival?
