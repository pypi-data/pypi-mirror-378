Hey there! The marina looks calm—how’s your evening shaping up?

It’s a glassy evening on the water—perfect for paddling. We check in at Marina Hut B, with starts at 18:30 and 19:15 depending on sunset.

When is the best glow window, and do you have tandem kayaks?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use bioluminescence window and fleet details.

The bioluminescence is best about 30 to 45 minutes after sunset, and we have both single and tandem kayaks. We’ll size PFDs from Youth through XXL.

Can you check the harbor advisory feed for any manatee zones active right now?

Beyond system; special flag.

[ATTENTION] Harbor advisories and current manatee notices are being reviewed. I'm looking into this.
