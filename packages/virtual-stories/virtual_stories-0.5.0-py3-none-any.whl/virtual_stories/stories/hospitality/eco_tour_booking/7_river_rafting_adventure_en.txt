Perfect! Your Conservation Rapid Run is booked—confirmation RAFT-4457. You'll meet at the river center at 8:30 AM tomorrow.

During your trip, you'll see our salmon restoration projects firsthand. We maintain artificial redds (salmon nests) and remove invasive plants that compete with native vegetation. Your guide will explain how these efforts are helping bring back Idaho's famous salmon runs.

The rapids are exciting but manageable for intermediate rafters, and the conservation stops make this tour really special!

user:
That sounds amazing! I've always wanted to learn more about salmon restoration. What's the lodge doing to support local conservation efforts beyond the tours?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about broader conservation efforts. This is small talk about environmental initiatives - no tool needed. Share lodge conservation programs from system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
We're deeply committed to river conservation! Beyond our tours, we:

- Organize monthly river cleanup events that remove 500+ pounds of trash annually
- Partner with Idaho Fish and Game on salmon monitoring programs
- Maintain 10 miles of riverbank trails with native plant restoration
- Support local schools with environmental education grants
- Use electric shuttles to reduce our carbon footprint for river access

Our goal is to protect this beautiful river system for future generations while providing amazing rafting experiences. You'll see the impact of these programs during your tour tomorrow.

We're excited to share our conservation story with you—it's rafters like you who help make these efforts successful!
