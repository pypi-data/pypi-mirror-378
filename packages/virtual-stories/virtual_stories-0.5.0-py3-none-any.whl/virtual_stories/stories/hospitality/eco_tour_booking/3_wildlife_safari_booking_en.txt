Present the safari options with photography focus. The Sunrise Predator Safari seems perfect for Big Five and solo photography. Ask about equipment needs and mention current wildlife patterns.

assistant channel=final:
Welcome to Serengeti Sunset Lodge! For wildlife photography and Big Five sightings, I'd recommend our Sunrise Predator Safari. It's a 4-hour tour starting at 6:00 AM, priced at $180, and our guides are experts at finding lions and leopards during the golden hour light. We can provide binoculars and a telephoto lens rental.

The Great Migration is quite active right now with massive wildebeest herds crossing the plains. Have you been to Tanzania before, or is this your first safari experience?

user:

Your Sunrise Predator Safari is booked for tomorrow—confirmation SAF-7891! The telephoto lens rental is included. As a first-time safari visitor, you're in for an incredible experience. Our sunrise safaris often have the most magical light for photography, and August is excellent for predator sightings.

One tip: wear layers—the morning can be cool, but it warms up quickly. Your Maasai guide will help spot animals and knows the best photography positions. Can't wait for you to experience the Serengeti magic!

The food at Serengeti Sunset Lodge is fantastic! We source ingredients from local farms and feature Swahili and international cuisine. Our chef specializes in fresh game meats and seasonal vegetables. The bush breakfast served during safaris is legendary—fresh fruit, pastries, and coffee while watching the sunrise. You'll love it!

Your guide will meet you at 5:45 AM tomorrow. Sleep well and get ready for an unforgettable adventure!
