We’ll have about 55 people—do we need a permit and can you soft-hold the pavilion?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use permit threshold and hold policy.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—groups of 50+ need a city picnic permit, and we can place a 2-hour soft hold on the pavilion with a decision due 48 hours prior. If weather shifts, we’ll pivot to the south lawn backup at the hotel.

user:
Does your weekend shuttle stop near the playground?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use shuttle loop facts.

assistant channel=final:
On weekends, the shuttle loops every 30 minutes from 09:00–18:00 and stops at the park’s main entrance, which is a short walk to the playground.

user:
Your lobby lemon water is refreshing!

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
Glad it hit the spot—we keep it chilled for sunny days.

user:
Could you confirm whether the city is lifting the charcoal-only rule to allow propane this month?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system context (city park rule change). Special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for checking on the grill regulations. This is being reviewed with the relevant contacts.
