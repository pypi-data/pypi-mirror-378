user:
Can we do three simultaneous breakouts at 10 AM and still have the keynote in Crest A at 11:30?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use room capacities and scheduling feasibility.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—that schedule works. You can run three breakouts at 10:00 using Seabird 1–3 (each up to 40 classroom), then pivot to the 11:30 keynote in Crest A (240 theater). We’ll set the coffee refresh to land between sessions.

user:
We’d like to record the keynote and own the videos. Any restrictions?

assistant channel=analysis:
State recording rights and signage requirement.

assistant channel=final:
You retain the IP for recorded sessions. We’ll ask you to place consent signage at the entrances, and we don’t distribute the content on house channels. The Recording add-on pairs well with the Enhanced AV package (8K projector and confidence monitor).

user:
Compliments to your AV techs—yesterday’s transition was smooth.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
I’ll relay that to the crew—they’ll appreciate the feedback.

user:
Could you confirm if the convention center next door will allow us to beam a live wireless link to their hall at noon?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system context (external venue wireless permissions). Special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Appreciate the cross-venue question. This is being checked with the appropriate teams.
