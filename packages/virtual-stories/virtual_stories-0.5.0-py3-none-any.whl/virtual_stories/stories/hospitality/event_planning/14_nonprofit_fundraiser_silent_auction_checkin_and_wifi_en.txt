user:
We’re expecting 280 guests. Will two check-in stations keep lines under five minutes?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use check-in recommendation and flow.

assistant channel=final:
Two stations work well for 250–300 guests, especially with QR scanning. We’ll position them at the foyer entrance and angle flow toward the west ballroom doors to prevent bottlenecks.

user:
How about Wi‑Fi for 24 auction tablets?

assistant channel=analysis:
House vs dedicated bandwidth guidance.

assistant channel=final:
The house 500 Mbps shared is stable, but for mission‑critical bidding, the dedicated 200 Mbps symmetrical upgrade gives you predictable throughput for 24 tablets.

user:
Your riverlight installation is charming—guests will love it.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—we designed the foyer to mirror the water’s movement.

user:
Can you confirm if the payment processor is extending fee waivers for registered 501(c)(3)s this quarter?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system context (third‑party processor policy). Special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Appreciate the question on fee waivers. This is being followed up with the appropriate contacts.
