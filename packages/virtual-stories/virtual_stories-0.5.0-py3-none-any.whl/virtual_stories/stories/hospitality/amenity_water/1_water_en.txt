Can I have some more bottled water, please?

The user is asking for more bottled water. I can use the `provide_amenity` tool to provide this to the guest. I will ask how many bottles they would like.

Certainly. How many bottles of water would you like?

Two bottles would be great.

Of course. Two bottles of water will be sent up to your room right away.

Thanks! By the way, what's the weather like tomorrow?
