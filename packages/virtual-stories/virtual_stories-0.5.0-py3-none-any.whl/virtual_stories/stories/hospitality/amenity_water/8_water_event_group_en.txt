Hello! I'm organizing a corporate meeting for about 50 people tomorrow. Do you provide bulk water service for groups?

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We specialize in corporate events at Summit Conference Center. For a 50-person meeting, we can provide comprehensive water service. What type of water would you prefer - still, sparkling, or a mix? And what's the duration of your meeting?

We need a mix of still and sparkling water for a 4-hour meeting. We'll be in the Grand Ballroom.

Perfect! I've arranged 75 bottles each of still and sparkling water for your meeting, with delivery at 7 AM tomorrow. This includes hydration stations, ice service, and glassware. Would you like to add any other group services like coffee service or snacks?

user:
The water service sounds comprehensive! Can you also set up water stations throughout the ballroom?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants water stations set up throughout the ballroom. I should coordinate this additional service.

Excellent! I've arranged four water stations throughout the Grand Ballroom - at the entrance, main area, and breakout spaces. Each station will have both still and sparkling options with a dedicated attendant for service during your 4-hour meeting.

user:
This is fantastic! Denver's business community is so vibrant. By the way, what's your favorite local networking event?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about local networking events. This doesn't require specific information from my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! Denver has a thriving business community. I don't have personal favorites since I focus on event coordination, but many of our corporate clients enjoy the various networking events in the downtown area.

user:
Actually, I was wondering about the history of conference centers and how they evolved in American business culture.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the history of conference centers, which is detailed historical information not available in my basic system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research the history of conference centers for you.

assistant channel=analysis:
I should offer alternative assistance while the information is being gathered.

assistant channel=final:
While I look into that, I can tell you that conference centers became popular in the mid-20th century with the growth of corporate America. If you'd like, I can provide information about current event services or help with additional meeting arrangements.
