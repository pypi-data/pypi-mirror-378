user:
Hello! I'm quite particular about water quality. Can you tell me about your water filtration and purification systems?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is concerned about water quality and wants to know about our filtration systems. This is perfect for our modern eco-hotel with advanced water technology. I should explain our filtration system and provide quality information.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent question! At AquaPure Hotel, we pride ourselves on our advanced water purification systems. What aspect interests you most - the filtration stages, purification methods, or quality testing processes?

user:
I'd like to know about the filtration stages and what contaminants are removed.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to know about filtration stages and contaminant removal. I should explain our multi-stage system in detail.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.explain_filtration_system:
{"system_component": "filtration_stages", "detail_level": "detailed"}

tool.explain_filtration_system channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"stages": ["pre_filtration", "reverse_osmosis", "carbon_filtration", "mineral_enhancement", "uv_sterilization"], "contaminants_removed": ["heavy_metals", "chlorine", "pesticides", "bacteria", "viruses"], "efficiency": "99.9%"}

assistant channel=analysis:
I have detailed information about our filtration stages. I should explain this comprehensively.

assistant channel=final:
Our system uses five stages: pre-filtration removes large particles, reverse osmosis eliminates dissolved solids, carbon filtration removes chlorine and organic compounds, mineral enhancement adds beneficial minerals, and UV sterilization destroys microorganisms. We remove 99.9% of heavy metals, chlorine, pesticides, bacteria, and viruses.

user:
That's very thorough! How often do you test the water quality?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about testing frequency, which is detailed information I have in my system prompt about our quality standards.

assistant channel=final:
We maintain the highest standards with continuous sensor monitoring and daily laboratory testing. Our systems are certified to exceed Canadian drinking water guidelines, and we conduct comprehensive testing for pH, minerals, and contaminants every 24 hours.

user:
Impressive! Vancouver has such high environmental standards. By the way, what's your favorite local environmental initiative?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about local environmental initiatives. This doesn't require specific information from my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! Vancouver indeed has strong environmental standards. I don't have personal favorites since I focus on water quality, but our guests often appreciate the city's various environmental initiatives.

user:
Actually, I was wondering about the history of water purification technology and how it evolved in Canada.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the history of water purification technology, which is detailed historical information not available in my basic system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research water purification technology history for you.

assistant channel=analysis:
I should offer alternative assistance while the information is being gathered.

assistant channel=final:
While I look into that, I can tell you that Canada has been a leader in water treatment since the early 20th century. If you'd like, I can provide information about our current filtration technology or arrange a tour of our water systems.
