All made with organic Napa Valley ingredients. Would you like a tasting set or full bottles?

user:
A tasting set sounds great! Can you tell me more about the Lemon Mint infusion?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants more information about the Lemon Mint infusion. I should provide detailed flavor profile information.

user:
That sounds delicious! Napa Valley is known for its incredible produce. By the way, what's your favorite local vineyard?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about local vineyards. This doesn't require specific information from my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! Napa Valley's produce is indeed exceptional. I don't have personal favorites since I focus on our beverage curation, but our guests enjoy exploring the various vineyards in the area.

user:
Actually, I was wondering about the history of Napa Valley's wine culture and how it influenced local cuisine.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about Napa Valley's wine culture history, which is detailed historical information not available in my basic system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research Napa Valley's wine culture history for you.

assistant channel=analysis:
I should offer alternative assistance while the information is being gathered.

assistant channel=final:
While I look into that, I can tell you that Napa Valley has been a wine destination since the 19th century. If you'd like, I can provide information about current wine tastings or arrange a visit to local vineyards.
