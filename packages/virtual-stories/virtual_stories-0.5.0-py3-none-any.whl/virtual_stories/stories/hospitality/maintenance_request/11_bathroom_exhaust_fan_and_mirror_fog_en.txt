user:
Hi—my bathroom exhaust fan seems weak, and the mirror fogs up so fast. I’ve got a call in 30 minutes. Any quick fix?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer immediate steps and realistic ETA per system.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for flagging this. I can dispatch engineering with an ETA of about 10–20 minutes to check airflow. In the meantime, I can send a microfiber cloth and a small defog spray, and we can place a portable fan to clear steam faster. Would you like those right away?

user:
Yes please. Do Club rooms have anti-fog mirrors? I’m on level 24.

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from system: Club level has warmers; others by request if available.

assistant channel=final:
Club-level rooms include anti-fog mirror warmers by default. On other floors, we can install a warmer if we have a spare in inventory—engineering can advise during the visit.

user:
Could you certify in writing the ventilation meets ASHRAE 62.1 with measured CFM data for my insurer today?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond typical scope; trigger special flag.
