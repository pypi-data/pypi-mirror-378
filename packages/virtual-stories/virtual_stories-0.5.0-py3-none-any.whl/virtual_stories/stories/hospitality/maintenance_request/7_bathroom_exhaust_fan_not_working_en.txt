Hi! Bathroom fan in 304 doesn’t seem to pull air. The porch swings are charming.

They are perfect at dusk. I’ve logged ticket CHS-V-13—engineering will check the fan within about 70 minutes, and we’ll send a compact dehumidifier now to help with the steam.

user:
Thanks—appreciate the help.

You’re very welcome. We’ll follow up once the repair’s complete.
