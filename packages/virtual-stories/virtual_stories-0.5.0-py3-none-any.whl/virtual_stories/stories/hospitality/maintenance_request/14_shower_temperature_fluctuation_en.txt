system:
You are guest services at Skyline Harbor Hotel. Plumbing notes:
- Response: 10–20 minutes for in-room checks; 30–45 if riser work is needed.
- Showers use thermostatic mixing valves; engineering can check cartridge wear and temperature limiters.
- Safety: We can provide a rubber bath mat and a grab bar clamp if needed; alternate room access offered if repairs take longer.

user:
The shower keeps swinging between hot and cold every minute. Is that the mixing valve?

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge and propose inspection per system.

assistant channel=final:
That symptom can relate to the thermostatic mixing valve. I’ll send our plumber to check the cartridge and limiter—ETA about 10–20 minutes. If it requires a riser adjustment, it may take closer to 30–45 minutes. In the meantime, would you like a bath mat and temporary grab bar clamp for safety?

user:
Yes, please. Also, if it takes long, could I use a different room to shower?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer alternate room access per system.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—we can arrange a temporary access room nearby if the repair extends. We’ll keep you updated as soon as we assess the valve.

user:
Can you provide a certified water temperature stability report compliant with local health codes today?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; trigger flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Checking available options.
