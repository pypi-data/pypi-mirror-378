Hi—shower in 811 keeps going from hot to cold and back. Love the tea selection here!

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge tea; schedule plumber priority medium. Reservation RSV811.

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide ETA and possible workaround.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—we just added a new oolong. I’ve scheduled ticket PL-202 with a 60‑minute ETA to check the mixing valve and pressure. Meanwhile, starting with a steady warm setting can reduce swings.

user:
Appreciate the tip.

assistant channel=final:
We’ll update you when the plumber is en route.
