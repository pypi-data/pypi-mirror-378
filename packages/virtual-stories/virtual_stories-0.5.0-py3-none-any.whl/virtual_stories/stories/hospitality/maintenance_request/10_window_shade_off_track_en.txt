Hi—shade in 733 is crooked and clicks at the top. The espresso smells fantastic.

Acknowledge espresso; book a 60‑minute window. Reservation RSV733.

Confirm and advise not to run the motor.

It’s our house blend—nutty and bright. I’ve booked ticket SHD-11; a technician will realign and recalibrate within ~50 minutes. Please avoid running the motor until we arrive to prevent wear.

Will do—thank you.

Thanks for your patience. We’ll restore smooth operation shortly.
