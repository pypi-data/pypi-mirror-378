Can you recommend the best local hiking trails near the hotel?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about local hiking trails. While we have mountain views mentioned in the system, specific trail recommendations go beyond our available context which focuses on hotel facilities and services. This requires external knowledge about the surrounding area.
