Hi, my beagle Olive has sensitive skin. Can we get a bath with hypoallergenic shampoo at 4 PM? Reservation RSV88881.

Olive is booked for 4:00 PM (ID GROOM-29). We’ll use our hypoallergenic oatmeal shampoo and keep the rinse lukewarm for comfort. Anything else helps her relax—maybe a favorite toy?

user:
She likes a squeaky duck. And your dog park mural is adorable.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
We’ll have a squeaky duck on standby—and glad you like the mural!
