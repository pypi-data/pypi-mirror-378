We hit a few puddles—can we rinse our dog somewhere and dry off after?

Provide rinse station details, towels, mats, and dryer policy. Small talk.

Absolutely—sounds like an adventurous walk! The Service Patio on L-1 has a warm-water rinse station until 19:00. We’ll send a couple of pet towels and a floor-protection mat to your room, and you can borrow our low-heat dryer from the Concierge with an ID hold for up to 2 hours.

Do you carry hypoallergenic dog shampoo?
