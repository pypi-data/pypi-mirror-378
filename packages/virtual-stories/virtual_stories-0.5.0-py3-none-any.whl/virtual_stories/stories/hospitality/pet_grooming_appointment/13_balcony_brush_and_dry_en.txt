system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Pet-friendly floors: 6–8. Housekeeping requests: use a spare sheet under grooming areas; call Housekeeping for an extra vacuum pass if needed (subject to availability). Dryers allowed before 22:00; keep balcony door partially closed to reduce fur drift.

user:
Could I brush my husky on the balcony and then do a quick blow dry?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide best practices per system; mention spare sheet and vacuum pass.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—that’s actually helpful for cleanup. Place a spare sheet under the grooming area and we’ll note a courtesy vacuum pass with Housekeeping if available. A low-heat dryer is fine before 22:00; keeping the balcony door mostly closed helps prevent fur drifting back inside.

user:
Is there a way to schedule a professional de-shedding treatment tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Professional services scheduling is beyond context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Checking evening availability now.
