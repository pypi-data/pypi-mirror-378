I'm an art collector visiting Chicago for the first time. What art galleries or exhibits should I absolutely not miss?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is an art collector seeking must-see galleries in Chicago. I should use the tool to find contemporary and classical art options in the city.

{"galleries":[{"name":"Art Institute of Chicago","description":"World-renowned collection including Impressionist masterpieces","current_exhibit":"Modern Wing featuring contemporary installations","hours":"10:30 AM - 5:00 PM","admission":"$30 general admission"},{"name":"MCA Chicago","description":"Museum of Contemporary Art with cutting-edge exhibits","current_exhibit":"Digital art and interactive installations","hours":"10:00 AM - 5:00 PM","admission":"$18 general admission"},{"name":"Smart Museum of Art","description":"University of Chicago's art collection with focus on classical and contemporary","current_exhibit":"Ancient artifacts and modern photography","hours":"11:00 AM - 4:00 PM","admission":"Free for University of Chicago affiliates, $10 general"}]}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool provided excellent gallery recommendations. I should highlight the unique aspects and offer transportation assistance since the hotel provides complimentary art gallery shuttle service.

assistant channel=final:
Welcome to Chicago's vibrant art scene! As an art collector, you must visit the Art Institute of Chicago—home to masterpieces by Monet, Van Gogh, and Picasso. The MCA Chicago is showcasing fascinating digital art installations, and the Smart Museum offers a unique blend of classical and contemporary works. Would you like me to arrange our complimentary shuttle service to any of these galleries?

user:
The MCA Chicago sounds intriguing with its digital art exhibit. I love how technology and art intersect. What's the best time to visit to avoid crowds?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is interested in the MCA and wants crowd-avoidance tips. I should provide specific timing recommendations and additional details about the exhibit.

assistant channel=final:
The MCA's digital art exhibit is truly innovative! For the best experience with fewer crowds, I recommend visiting early on weekdays—aim for opening time around 10:00 AM. Evenings after 3:00 PM can also be quieter. The current exhibit features interactive light installations and AI-generated art that really comes alive in person. Shall I check shuttle availability for tomorrow morning?

user:
Actually, I'm also interested in some street art and public installations. Are there any notable ones nearby?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants information about street art and public installations. I should provide details about Chicago's public art scene, including well-known installations in the area.

{"public_art":[{"name":"Cloud Gate (The Bean)","description":"Iconic public sculpture in Millennium Park","location":"5-minute walk from hotel","best_time":"sunrise or after dark when illuminated"},{"name":"Chicago Picasso","description":"Massive abstract sculpture by Pablo Picasso","location":"10-minute walk","historical_significance":"First public artwork funded by percent-for-art ordinance"},{"name":"Wall of Respect","description":"Mural celebrating African American heroes","location":"15-minute walk","cultural_importance":"Oldest surviving African American mural in Chicago"}]}

assistant channel=analysis:
Perfect information about Chicago's public art. I should provide walking directions and viewing tips for these iconic pieces.

assistant channel=final:
Chicago has incredible public art! The Cloud Gate (affectionately called The Bean) is just a 5-minute walk from our hotel—it's mesmerizing at sunrise or when illuminated at night. The Chicago Picasso statue is another 5 minutes beyond that. For something with cultural significance, the Wall of Respect mural is worth the 15-minute walk. Would you like a quick walking map to any of these?
