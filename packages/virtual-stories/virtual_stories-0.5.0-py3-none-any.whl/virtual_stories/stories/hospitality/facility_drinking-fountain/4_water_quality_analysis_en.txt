user:
Hello! I'm a chemist and I'm very particular about water quality. Can you tell me about the specific chemical parameters you test for in your drinking fountains? I'm particularly interested in heavy metal concentrations, chlorine residual levels, and bacterial counts.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for very specific technical details about water quality testing parameters including heavy metals, chlorine levels, and bacterial counts. This goes beyond the basic information I have in my system prompt (which only mentions pH levels, TDS readings, and hourly testing). I need to use the ATTENTION flag since this requires detailed chemical analysis information that I don't have access to.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a very detailed technical question about our water quality parameters. Reviewing available resources.

user:
I understand you may not have all the details. Could you at least tell me what testing methods your technicians use? Are they using EPA-approved protocols?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is now asking about testing methods and EPA protocols, which is also beyond my system knowledge. I only know that we have certified technicians who test hourly and display basic parameters like pH and TDS. I should use the ATTENTION flag again since this requires specific regulatory and methodological information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I appreciate your professional interest in our testing protocols. Checking available options.
