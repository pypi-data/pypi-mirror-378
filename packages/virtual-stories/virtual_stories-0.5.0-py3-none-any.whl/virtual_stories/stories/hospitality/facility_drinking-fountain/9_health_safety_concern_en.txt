user:
Hello, I have a serious concern about the drinking fountains. I just saw someone coughing directly into one of them, and I'm worried about contamination and the spread of germs. What are your protocols for handling this kind of situation?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is raising a legitimate health and safety concern about potential contamination of drinking fountains. While I have information about our maintenance and sanitization schedules, I don't have specific protocols for handling contamination incidents or emergency sanitization procedures. This requires specialized health and safety knowledge that goes beyond my system information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a very important health and safety concern. Reviewing available resources.

user:
I'm also concerned about the overall hygiene standards. How do you ensure the fountains are safe for public use, especially during flu season or health outbreaks?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about hygiene standards and safety protocols during health outbreaks. While I have information about our regular maintenance schedule and water quality testing, I don't have specific information about enhanced hygiene protocols during health outbreaks or flu season. This requires specialized public health knowledge and outbreak response procedures.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Your concern about hygiene standards during health outbreaks is very valid. Checking available options.
