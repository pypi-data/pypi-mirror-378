Hi—can you send a mixed set of clips to 1804? Also, is 1804 on the same-corridor delivery?

Answer executive corridor policy; check inventory; schedule delivery.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—floors 17–24 receive same-corridor delivery, so 1804 qualifies. I’ll check what’s in stock for a mixed set.
