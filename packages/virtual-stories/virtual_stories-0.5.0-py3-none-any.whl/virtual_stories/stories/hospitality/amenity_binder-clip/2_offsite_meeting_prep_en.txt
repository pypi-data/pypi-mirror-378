Hi! I’m putting together client packets. Do you have medium binder clips, and what’s the usual delivery time?

Answer policy question from system, then check inventory for clips_fasteners.

Yes—our standard delivery window is 30–45 minutes hotel-wide. Let me check what we have in clips and fasteners for you.

assistant channel=final:
We do—medium binder clips (32mm) are in stock with 42 available. What quantity do you need and which room should we deliver to?

Room 3116, please send 12 medium clips. Also, is 3116 considered an executive floor for same-floor delivery?

Confirm executive floor policy from system and create delivery request.

Yes—floors 28–36 are executive, so 3116 qualifies for same-floor delivery.
