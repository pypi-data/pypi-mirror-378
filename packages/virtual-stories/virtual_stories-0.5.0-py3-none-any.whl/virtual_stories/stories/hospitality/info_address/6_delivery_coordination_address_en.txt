I'm staying here for three weeks on business and need to coordinate several important deliveries. Could you give me the complete address with any special delivery instructions?

Perfect. I'm expecting documents, some tech equipment, and daily catered lunches. What should I know about your delivery procedures?

Excellent! All deliveries go through our secure dock at Level B1 with security screening. Documents get chain-of-custody tracking, tech equipment requires authorization for items over $500, and catered food must be from pre-approved vendors. As an executive-level guest, you get priority same-day room delivery.

user:
That's very thorough! This seems like a well-run operation here.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! We pride ourselves on seamless business support. Would you like me to coordinate with any specific vendors or set up authorization for your expected deliveries?

user:
Actually yes, that would be helpful. By the way, do you know what time the New York Stock Exchange opens? I need to coordinate some calls.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about NYSE opening hours, which is external market information not related to hotel services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Let me check the current market hours information for you.
