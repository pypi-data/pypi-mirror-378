It's a interdisciplinary research conference covering environmental science, policy, and engineering. Actually, do you know what the local weather patterns have been like this time of year? Some of our students are planning field research components.

assistant channel=analysis:
Student is asking about local weather patterns for field research planning, which is external meteorological information not related to hotel services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.
