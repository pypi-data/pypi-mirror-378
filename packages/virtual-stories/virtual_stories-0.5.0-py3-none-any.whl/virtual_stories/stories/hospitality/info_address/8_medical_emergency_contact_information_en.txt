Much better, thank you for asking. By the way, my insurance company called and asked what the current hospital bed rates are in this area. Do you happen to know those pricing details?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about hospital bed rates in the local area, which is external healthcare pricing information not related to our hotel services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.
