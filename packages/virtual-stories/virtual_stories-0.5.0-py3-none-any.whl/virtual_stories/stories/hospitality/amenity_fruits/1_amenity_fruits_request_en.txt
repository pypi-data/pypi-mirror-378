I'm feeling a bit peckish. Could I get a bowl of fresh fruits sent to my room, please? I'm in room 305.

The user wants to order a bowl of fresh fruits. I can use the `order_room_service` tool for this. The item name is "fresh fruit platter", the room number is 305, and the quantity is 1.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.order_room_service:
{"item_name": "fresh fruit platter", "room_number": "305", "quantity": 1}

tool.order_room_service channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A fresh fruit platter is being prepared for room 305."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The room service order was successful. I will let the user know that their fruit platter is on its way. I will also add a chitchat about the beach.

assistant channel=final:
Of course! A delicious fresh fruit platter is being prepared for you and will be delivered to your room shortly. Have you had a chance to enjoy our private beach yet?

user:
Not yet, but I'm planning to go this afternoon. I was wondering if the hotel provides snorkeling gear.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about snorkeling gear. I do not have information about this. I will use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That sounds like a wonderful plan. Regarding the snorkeling gear, I'm looking into this.
