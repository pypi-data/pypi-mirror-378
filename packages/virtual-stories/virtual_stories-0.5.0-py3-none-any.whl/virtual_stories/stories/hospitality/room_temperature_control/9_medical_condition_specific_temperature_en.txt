Hello, I hope you can help me with something quite specific. I have multiple sclerosis, and temperature regulation is really important for managing my symptoms. Heat makes my MS symptoms much worse - I get weakness, fatigue, and cognitive issues when I'm too warm. I need to keep my room quite cool, around 18-19 degrees Celsius, and it needs to stay very stable. Even small temperature increases can trigger problems for me. Is this something your climate control system can handle precisely? I'm here for medical appointments this week, so maintaining my health is crucial.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest has multiple sclerosis requiring precise cool temperature (18-19°C) for symptom management. Heat sensitivity causes weakness, fatigue, cognitive issues. Needs high precision temperature stability for medical appointment week. Configure medical-grade climate control with stability monitoring.
