Hi! Random question—do you think the mural in the lobby looks like waves or mountains? I go back and forth.

assistant channel=analysis:
Light small talk, then offer assistance.

assistant channel=final:
I see both—morning light makes it look like waves, but by dusk it’s definitely mountains. How can I help with your order tonight?

user:
Craving noodles. What’s the latest I can place an order, and can you hold it at the desk for half an hour?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer: Noodle Harbor cutoff 23:30; we can hold in fridge up to 4 hours.

assistant channel=final:
For noodles, "Noodle Harbor" takes orders until 23:30. We’ll label your bag and can hold it in our fridge for up to 4 hours—half an hour is easy.

user:
Could you share the historical on-time delivery percentage by vendor over the last quarter?
