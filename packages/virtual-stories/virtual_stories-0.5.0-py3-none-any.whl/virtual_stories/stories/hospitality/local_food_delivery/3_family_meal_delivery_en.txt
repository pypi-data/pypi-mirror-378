What a wonderful celebration! I've arranged delivery from Mama Rosa's Italian Kitchen with their family-style lasagna dinner for 8 people. The meal will arrive in about 45 minutes and includes a complimentary birthday table setup with decorations. I've also added a beautiful chocolate birthday cake with a special message for your grandmother.

That's perfect! The kids will love the lasagna, and Grandma will be thrilled with the cake. How do you handle special dietary needs?

Guest is asking about dietary accommodations. This is chitchat that doesn't require tools - I can share from system knowledge.

We're glad you're excited! For dietary needs, all our partner restaurants provide detailed ingredient lists and can accommodate most requirements. Just let us know about any allergies or preferences when you call down - we can modify orders or choose different restaurants that better fit your family's needs.
