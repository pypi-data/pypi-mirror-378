Hi, I'm in villa 7. I forgot to pack dental floss. Can you help me out?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest in villa 7 needs dental floss. I can use the `dispatch_housekeeping_item` tool to send it to them.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.dispatch_housekeeping_item:
{"item": "Dental Floss", "room_number": "7"}

tool.dispatch_housekeeping_item channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "Dental floss has been dispatched to villa 7. Estimated arrival: 10 minutes."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I will let the guest know that dental floss is on the way.

assistant channel=final:
Of course. I've dispatched dental floss to your villa. It should be there in about 10 minutes.

user:
Thank you! By the way, this resort is beautiful. It's so peaceful.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is making a positive comment about the resort. I should respond warmly.

assistant channel=final:
You are most welcome. I'm delighted to hear you're enjoying the tranquility of our resort. That is exactly the experience we hope to create for our guests.

user:
I read about your organic garden. Is it possible to take a tour?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about a tour of the organic garden. This is not in my system prompt and I don't have a tool to check for this information. I will use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a wonderful question. I am gathering relevant data.
