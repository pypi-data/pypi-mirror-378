Is 705 set up with allergen‑free bedding? I’m sensitive to down.

Affirm hypoallergenic options; offer pillow choices.

Yes—our allergen‑free set uses synthetic duvet fill and no down. For pillows, we can provide microfiber soft, latex core medium, or a breathable bamboo blend. Would you like a particular combination?

Two latex core pillows, please. Do you use fabric softener?
