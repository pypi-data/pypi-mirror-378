Cooling Strategy:
1) Bamboo Eco set: breathable sheets and duvet, naturally moisture‑wicking.
2) Swap time: ~20 minutes; minimal disruption.
3) Combine with low‑loft pillows to reduce heat retention.
4) Evening swaps available until 22:30.
5) Housekeeping collects original linens for laundering immediately.
