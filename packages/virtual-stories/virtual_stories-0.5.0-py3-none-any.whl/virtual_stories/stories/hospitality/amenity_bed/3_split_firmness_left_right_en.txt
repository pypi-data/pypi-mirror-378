Hey, can you make the left side of bed in 340 softer and the right side a tad firmer?

Check zones; then set left to 3 and right to 7 for contrast.

Done—left is set to 3, right to 7. They’ll settle in a few minutes for a balanced feel.

Sounds like a lovely evening view.

Can you also add aromatherapy to the room?
