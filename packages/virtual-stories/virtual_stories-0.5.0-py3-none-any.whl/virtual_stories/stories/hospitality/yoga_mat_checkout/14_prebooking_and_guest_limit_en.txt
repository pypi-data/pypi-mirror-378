user:
Hi! Any chance I can prebook two Long mats for 7 PM?

assistant channel=final:
We loan mats on demand rather than reservations. If both guests are registered, we can issue them when you arrive.

user:
Could you bend the rule and earmark them now?

assistant channel=analysis:
No reservations; beyond scope—flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Setting holds in advance isn't part of our loan policy. Working on your request.
