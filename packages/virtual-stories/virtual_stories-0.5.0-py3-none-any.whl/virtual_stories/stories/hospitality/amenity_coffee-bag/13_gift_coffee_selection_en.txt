Hi! I'm staying in room 2145 and I'd like to get some coffee as a gift for my friend who's a real coffee enthusiast. What would you recommend?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for coffee gift recommendations for a coffee enthusiast friend. I should recommend premium options that would make good gifts, focusing on the higher-end single-origin and specialty blends that would appeal to a coffee lover.

assistant channel=final:
Hello! For a coffee enthusiast friend, I'd highly recommend our Single Origin Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - it's a premium 8oz bag ($35) with bright citrus and floral notes that any coffee lover would appreciate. We also have Pike Place Signature Whole Bean ($22) which is a classic Seattle blend, or Pacific Northwest Dark Blend ($24) for someone who prefers bold flavors. All our bags come beautifully packaged and would make excellent gifts. Which sounds most appealing for your friend?

user:
The Ethiopian single origin sounds perfect! My friend loves trying unique coffee varieties. Can you deliver it to my room?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to order the Ethiopian single origin coffee for room delivery. I need to provide information about delivery options and timing.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice! The Ethiopian Yirgacheffe is perfect for a coffee enthusiast - it's a unique single-origin with bright citrus and floral notes that will definitely impress your friend. I'll arrange delivery to room 2145 - it should arrive within 25 minutes. The 8oz bag is $35, so there's a $5 delivery fee, making the total $40. The bag comes beautifully packaged and ready for gifting.

user:
Perfect! I'm really enjoying the harbor view from my room - it's absolutely stunning, especially with the morning light.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is making small talk about the harbor view, which is mentioned in the system prompt as a feature of room 2145. This is a nice chitchat moment that doesn't require any tools.

assistant channel=final:
I'm so glad you're enjoying the harbor view! Room 2145 does have one of our best panoramic harbor views with those floor-to-ceiling windows. The morning light reflecting off the water is truly spectacular. Your Ethiopian Yirgacheffe should be arriving shortly for your friend's gift!

user:
It really is magical! Do you know if there are any local coffee roasters or coffee shops that would be good for coffee enthusiasts to visit?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about local coffee roasters and coffee shops, which goes beyond the system prompt information about hotel amenities and services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since I don't have access to local business recommendations.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about local coffee roasters. Reviewing available resources.

user:
No worries, I'll ask the concierge. Thanks for your help with the coffee gift!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is thanking me and ending the conversation. I should provide a friendly closing response.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! Your friend will love the Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. Enjoy the beautiful harbor view and have a wonderful day!
