Good evening! I'm in room 2145 and I'd like to have some coffee this evening, but I need decaf since it's getting late. What decaf options do you have?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about decaf coffee options for evening enjoyment. I need to provide information about our decaf coffee offerings, focusing on the Swiss Water Process Decaf that's mentioned in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Good evening! We have Swiss Water Process Decaf available in 10oz bags for $20. It's a premium decaf coffee that maintains excellent flavor without the caffeine, perfect for evening enjoyment. The Swiss Water Process is a chemical-free decaffeination method that preserves the coffee's natural flavors. Would you like me to arrange delivery to room 2145?

user:
The Swiss Water Process Decaf sounds perfect! I love that it's chemical-free. Can you deliver it to my room?

Excellent choice! The Swiss Water Process Decaf is perfect for evening enjoyment - it's chemical-free and maintains great flavor without the caffeine. I'll arrange delivery to room 2145 - it should arrive within 25 minutes. The 10oz bag is $20, so there's a $5 delivery fee, making the total $25. You can use the premium coffee maker in your room for brewing.

Perfect! I'm really enjoying the harbor view from my room - it's absolutely stunning, especially with the evening light.

The guest is making small talk about the harbor view, which is mentioned in the system prompt as a feature of room 2145. This is a nice chitchat moment that doesn't require any tools.

assistant channel=final:
I'm so glad you're enjoying the harbor view! Room 2145 does have one of our best panoramic harbor views with those floor-to-ceiling windows. The evening light over the water is truly spectacular. Your Swiss Water Process Decaf should be arriving shortly for your evening coffee!

user:
It really is magical! Do you know if the hotel has any special evening coffee or dessert pairings available?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about special evening coffee or dessert pairings, which goes beyond the system prompt information about boutique coffee bags and basic amenities. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since I don't have specific information about restaurant offerings or special pairings.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about evening coffee pairings. Checking available options.

user:
No worries, I'll check with the restaurant. Thanks for your help with the decaf coffee!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is thanking me and ending the conversation. I should provide a friendly closing response.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! Enjoy your decaf coffee with the beautiful harbor view. Have a wonderful evening!
