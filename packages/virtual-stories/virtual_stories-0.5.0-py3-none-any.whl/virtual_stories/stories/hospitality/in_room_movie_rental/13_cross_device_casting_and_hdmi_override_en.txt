system:
Property: Bayfront Suites. Casting: supported via in‑room Chromecast on HotelCast SSID; isolated per room. Note: using casting switches TV input to Chromecast; returning to HDMI‑Hotel resumes Movie Library. DRM: some third‑party apps block casting of rentals; the in‑room Movie Library app plays titles without personal logins. Audio: TV ARC to soundbar where installed.

user:
Hi there! Nice view—how’s your shift going?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; then explain casting and HDMI behavior.

assistant channel=final:
Smooth sailing so far. You can cast over the HotelCast SSID to the in‑room Chromecast, which auto‑switches inputs; switching back to HDMI‑Hotel takes you to our Movie Library app.

user:
If a streaming app won’t cast a rental, can I still watch using your app?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer with DRM note.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—some third‑party rentals won’t cast due to DRM, but our in‑room Movie Library plays titles without personal logins.

user:
Could you send the Chromecast firmware version and current SSID key material?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Firmware specifics and SSID credentials are outside this context. Checking available options.
