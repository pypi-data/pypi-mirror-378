My reservation is ECH-BUSINESS-2025. I'm in the mood for a comedy or something light-hearted. Maybe something by my favorite director, but I want to be surprised by a good movie I haven't seen yet.

I've rented two movies that are critically acclaimed and offer different types of entertainment - one is a comedy-drama and the other is a unique, visually stunning film. I should provide details about the selections.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! I've rented two excellent films for your relaxation: "The Holdovers" - a heartwarming comedy-drama about an unlikely friendship during holiday break, and "Poor Things" - a visually stunning and unique film that's both funny and thought-provoking. Both are highly rated and perfect for unwinding. That's $12 total.
