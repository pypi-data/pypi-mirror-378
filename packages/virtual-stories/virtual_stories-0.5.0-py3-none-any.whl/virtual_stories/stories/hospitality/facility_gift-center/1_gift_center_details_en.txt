Hi, I'm looking for a gift to take back home. Do you have a gift shop?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about the gift shop. I will use the `get_gift_center_details` tool to provide the requested information.

{"name": "The Wanderer's Trove", "location": "ground floor, next to the main restaurant", "merchandise": ["Local handicrafts and souvenirs", "Hotel-branded merchandise", "Travel essentials", "Snacks and beverages"]}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool has provided the details for the gift center. I will now present this information to the user in a friendly and helpful way. I will also add a small talk to make the conversation more engaging.

assistant channel=final:
Yes, we do! Our gift center, "The Wanderer's Trove," is located on the ground floor, right next to our main restaurant. You'll find a wonderful selection of local handicrafts and souvenirs, as well as our own hotel-branded merchandise. We also carry travel essentials, snacks, and beverages. Are you looking for anything in particular?

user:
That sounds perfect. I'll check it out. Do you happen to know if they sell local pottery?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about a specific item (local pottery) in the gift shop. While the tool provided general categories, it didn't specify pottery. I will acknowledge the question and pass it to a background agent to get more specific information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a great question. I'll investigate this matter.
