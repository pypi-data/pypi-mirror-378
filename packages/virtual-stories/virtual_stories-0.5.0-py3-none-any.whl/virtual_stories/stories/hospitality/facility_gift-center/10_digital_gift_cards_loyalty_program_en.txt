Hi! I'm a frequent guest here and I'm interested in your loyalty program. I also need to buy some gift cards for my colleagues. What kind of rewards and gift card options do you offer?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about both our loyalty program and gift card options. I should get information about both services to provide comprehensive details.

assistant channel=analysis:
Great! I have comprehensive information about both our loyalty program and gift card options. I can provide details about benefits and help with their gift card needs.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful! As a frequent guest, you'll love our Wanderlust Rewards program. We have five tiers, and based on your stays, you might qualify for Gold level which gives you 15% discount on purchases, exclusive artist previews, and concierge shopping service. You earn points on all purchases - 1 point per dollar here, 2 points per dollar on hotel stays. For gift cards, we offer both digital and physical options in denominations from $25 to $1,000. Digital cards can be delivered instantly by email and they never expire. Since you mentioned colleagues, we also offer corporate bulk ordering with volume discounts for 10 or more cards. How many gift cards are you looking to purchase?

user:
I need about 15 gift cards for my team. That sounds like it would qualify for bulk pricing. What kind of discount would I get, and can I customize them somehow?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest needs 15 gift cards for their team, which definitely qualifies for bulk pricing. However, I don't have specific bulk discount percentages in my system knowledge. This would be an [ATTENTION] case where I need more detailed pricing information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a perfect quantity for our corporate bulk program! Investigating this matter for specific pricing details and customization options.

user:
The weather has been absolutely perfect for my stay here.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about the weather. I should respond naturally and briefly while maintaining a friendly tone.

assistant channel=final:
It really has been beautiful! Perfect weather always makes shopping and exploring so much more enjoyable.

user:
While I'm thinking about it, how does the points system work exactly? I stay here pretty regularly for business.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the points system details, which I have information about in my system prompt. I should provide clear details about earning and redemption.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.calculate_rewards_value:
{"purchase_amount": 500, "membership_tier": "gold"}

tool.calculate_rewards_value channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"points_earned": 500, "discount_applied": 75, "final_cost": 425, "tier_benefits": "Gold level 15% discount applied, exclusive access benefits included", "next_purchase_bonus": "Double points event next weekend"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Perfect! I can explain how the points system works and show them a practical example of the benefits.

assistant channel=final:
Great question! You earn 1 point for every dollar spent here in the gift center, and 2 points for every dollar on hotel stays - so your regular business stays really add up! For example, if you spent $500 here, you'd earn 500 points and with Gold status get a 15% discount, saving you $75. We also have double point events monthly and special bonuses. The points never expire, and you can use them for discounts or special experiences. Since you stay regularly, you might even qualify for Platinum level at 8,000 points, which gets you 20% discounts and private gallery events. Would you like me to look up your current point balance?

user:
That sounds great! I'm also wondering about your mobile app. Do you have one for managing rewards and gift cards?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about our mobile app for managing rewards and gift cards. While I mentioned "mobile app integration" in the system prompt, I don't have detailed information about specific app features or functionality. This would be an [ATTENTION] case.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's an excellent question about our mobile app features. Searching for more information about the current app capabilities.

user:
One more thing - can these gift cards be used at other Wanderlust properties? I know my colleagues travel to different locations.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about using gift cards at other Wanderlust properties. I have this information in my system prompt - the cards are valid at all Wanderlust Resort locations worldwide.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! That's one of the best features of our gift cards - they're valid at all Wanderlust Resort locations worldwide. Your colleagues can use them at any of our properties, whether they're traveling domestically or internationally. The cards also handle currency conversion automatically, so there's no hassle with exchange rates. It makes them perfect for business gifts since your team can use them wherever their travels take them. Plus, if they don't use the full amount at once, the remaining balance stays on the card for future visits.
