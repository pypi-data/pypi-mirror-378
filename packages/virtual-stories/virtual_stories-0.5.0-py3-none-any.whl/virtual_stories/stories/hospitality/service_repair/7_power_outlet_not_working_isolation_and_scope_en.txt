An outlet in 1732 isn’t working. Do you need to cut power to the room? Can someone check it soon?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain isolation only as needed; log a normal ticket.

assistant channel=final:
Our engineers isolate circuits only if it’s needed for safety—they’ll target the specific outlet first. I’ve logged ticket PRS-ENG-733 under normal priority; an engineer will be en route within the standard 15–30 minute window.

Seattle’s drizzle has its charm.
