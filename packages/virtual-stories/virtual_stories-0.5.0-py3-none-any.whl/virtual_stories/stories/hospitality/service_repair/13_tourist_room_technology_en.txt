user:
The smart TV in my room won't connect to the internet. I just got back from a long day of walking and wanted to watch a movie.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is a tired tourist who wants to relax but their smart TV is not working. I need to send a technician and also offer the complimentary drink voucher and city guide to help them unwind while the repair is being done.

assistant channel=final:
I apologize for the inconvenience. I'm sending a technician to your room now to fix the connection. While you wait, please accept a complimentary drink voucher for our hotel bar. We'd also like to offer you a 10% discount on your next stay.

user:
Thank you, I appreciate that. Is the hotel bar open late?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about the bar's hours, which is not in my system prompt. I will use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I am checking the bar's closing time for you.

user:
I was really looking forward to just relaxing in the room.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is expressing their disappointment. I should show empathy and suggest an alternative.

assistant channel=final:
I understand completely. Hopefully, the technician will have it fixed in no time. In the meantime, perhaps you can enjoy that drink at the bar while you look through the city guide for tomorrow's adventures.
