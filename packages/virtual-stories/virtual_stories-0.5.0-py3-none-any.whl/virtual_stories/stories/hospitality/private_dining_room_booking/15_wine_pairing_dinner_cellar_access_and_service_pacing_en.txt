Hi! Love the stone archways. Could we do the 6‑course reserve pairing and slightly faster pacing?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; 6-course reserve available; pacing can tighten to ~12 minutes between courses.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice. We’ll set the 6‑course reserve pairing and adjust pacing closer to 12 minutes between courses, with appropriate glassware for each pour.

Is there a chance for a brief cellar visit for guests?

Viewing corridor with staff escort; no self-access inside storage bays.

Yes—guests can tour the cellar viewing corridor with a staff escort. For safety, there’s no self‑access inside the storage bays.

Could you import a specific micro‑allocation from a foreign winery by Friday?
