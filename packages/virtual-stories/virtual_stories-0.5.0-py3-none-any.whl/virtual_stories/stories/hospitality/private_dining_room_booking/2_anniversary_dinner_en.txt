Happy anniversary! A private dinner is a wonderful way to celebrate. We have two private dining rooms available for tomorrow evening:

*   **The Wine Cellar:** A very intimate and romantic setting, perfect for two.
*   **The Garden Room:** A slightly larger room with a beautiful view of our gardens.

Do either of those rooms sound right for your celebration?
