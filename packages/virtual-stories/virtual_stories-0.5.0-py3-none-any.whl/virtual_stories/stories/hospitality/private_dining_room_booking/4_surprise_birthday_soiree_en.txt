Hi! I’d like to plan a surprise birthday dinner for 8 this Saturday at 6:30 PM—do you have the Maple Salon?

Wonderful news—the Maple Salon is available and I can hold it for your 6:30 PM celebration. The skylight makes evening light especially warm—perfect for a birthday reveal. Would you like us to bake a custom cake? We can do vanilla bean, flourless chocolate, or lemon elderflower (vegan option available). How many guests will the cake serve and what message should it say?

user:
Let’s do flourless chocolate for 10, message: “Happy 30th, Sam!”.

assistant channel=analysis:
Place cake order with size 10, confirm candles allowed, and proceed to reservation for 8 guests, 150 minutes.

Cake order placed (CAKE-1147), timed for 7:45 PM with candles ready. I’ve tentatively held your private room (RES-MAPLE-5321) from 6:30–9:00 PM for 8 guests. To confirm, may I have your name and a mobile number? We’ll include complimentary seasonal florals. valet parking is on 9th Ave.

I’m Taylor Brooks, 503-555-1189.

Confirm booking and add a brief friendly note.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks, Taylor—your surprise dinner is confirmed under RES-MAPLE-5321, and we’ll present the cake at 7:45 PM. We’ll keep the plan discreet; if Sam asks, we’ll say the Maple Salon was “chosen for the skylight.” Anything else—maybe a favorite song for the reveal over Bluetooth?
