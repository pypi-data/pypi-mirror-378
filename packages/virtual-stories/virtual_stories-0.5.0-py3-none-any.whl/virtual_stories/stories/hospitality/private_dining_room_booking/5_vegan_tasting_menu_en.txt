We can hold our quiet Luna Nook for you next Friday 7–9 PM (HOLD-LUNA-0829-1900). Our vegan tasting features heirloom tomato crudo, charred broccolini with almond miso, truffle-polenta with king oyster, and cacao mousse—paired with lychee-jasmine spritz, yuzu tonic, and oolong cold brew. The harbour breeze is lovely in the evening—would you like the lanterns dimmed and the mocktail pairing included?

user:
Yes please, and seating for four. No amplified music.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge seating for four; confirm no amplified music policy already in system; finalize soft details.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect—seating for four, lanterns gently dimmed, and no amplified music (Luna Nook is acoustically treated). When you arrive, use the Quay entrance for step-free access. Shall I note any allergies beyond vegan?
