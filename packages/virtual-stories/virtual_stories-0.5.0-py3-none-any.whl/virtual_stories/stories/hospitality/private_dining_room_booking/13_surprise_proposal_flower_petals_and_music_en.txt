Hi! The lanterns glow beautifully at dusk. Could we reserve the Private Nook for a proposal with silk petals and soft music?

Small talk; Private Nook seats 6; decor and music allowed per policy.

Romantic idea. The Private Nook seats up to 6 and includes curtains for semi‑privacy. Silk petals and LED votives are welcome, and we can play your Bluetooth playlist at a gentle dining volume.
