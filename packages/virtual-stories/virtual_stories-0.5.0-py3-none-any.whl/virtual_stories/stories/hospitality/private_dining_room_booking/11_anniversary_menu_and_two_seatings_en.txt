Hi! The candlelit vibe in the hallway art is lovely. Could we book Estuary for 8 guests at the late seating?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; Estuary capacity 16; late seating 20:15–22:30.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful choice. Estuary seats up to 16, so 8 guests will be comfortable. I can hold the late seating from 20:15 to 22:30 for your anniversary.

user:
We prefer the plant-forward five-course. Can we share dietary notes tomorrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
Dietary notes needed 72 hours preselect.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the plant-forward five-course is available. Please share dietary notes at least 72 hours prior so the chef can finalize.

user:
Could you also secure a harbor fireworks slot and permit that night?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for the special request. Examining various angles.
