Good morning! I'm planning a special Mother's Day surprise for my mom and I want to make it unforgettable with flowers. Can you help me create something extraordinary?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest wants elaborate Mother's Day flowers. Should ask for detailed preferences and offer our premium options.

assistant channel=final:
Good morning! Mother's Day is the perfect occasion for something special. I'd love to help you create an unforgettable floral surprise for your mom. What kind of flowers does she love, and what were you envisioning?

user:
She absolutely loves peonies and hydrangeas! I'd like something really luxurious. Maybe multiple deliveries throughout the day? My reservation is RSV99112. Could you start with breakfast delivery and then surprise her with more throughout the day?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest wants multiple deliveries with specific flowers. This is ambitious but doable. Should plan a sequence and confirm details.

assistant channel=final:
Peonies and hydrangeas are exquisite choices! I can definitely arrange multiple deliveries to make this Mother's Day extra special. Let me suggest a schedule:

1. **Breakfast delivery** - A smaller arrangement to start her day beautifully
2. **Brunch delivery** - Something more substantial to enjoy with her meal
3. **Afternoon delivery** - A luxurious centerpiece for her room
4. **Evening delivery** - A grand finale arrangement

Does that sound good? I'd need to know what messages you'd like for each delivery and your preferred times.

user:
That sounds perfect! Here's what I had in mind:

- 8 AM: "Good morning, beautiful Mom! Happy Mother's Day"
- 11 AM: "Enjoying your special day? Love you always"
- 3 PM: "Hope your day is filled with joy and relaxation"
- 7 PM: "The best mom deserves the best day! Love you forever"

All with peonies and hydrangeas. Reservation RSV99112.

Would you like me to help with any of these additional touches?

Perfect! I've scheduled a 90-minute Swedish massage with essential oils for your mom at 2:00 PM. The treatment will take place in our oceanfront spa with soothing views of the Atlantic.

She'll receive a reminder about 30 minutes before, and our spa team will escort her to the treatment room. They'll provide her with a plush robe and slippers, and she'll have access to our relaxation lounge afterward.

Your mom is going to have the most wonderful Mother's Day! The flowers, spa treatment, and beautiful ocean views will make it truly unforgettable. Is there anything else you'd like to add?
