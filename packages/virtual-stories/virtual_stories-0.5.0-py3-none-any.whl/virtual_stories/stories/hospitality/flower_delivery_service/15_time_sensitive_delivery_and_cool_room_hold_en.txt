Hello! Big night ahead—the lounge looks festive. How’s your shift?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; then outline windows and cool room hold.

assistant channel=final:
It’s buzzing in the best way. We can target delivery for 17:00–19:00, or tomorrow morning 09:00–11:00, and keep the arrangement in our cool room for up to six hours beforehand.

user:
If I miss the cutoff, can we still do it tonight somehow?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain cutoff and fallback.

assistant channel=final:
After 15:00 we can’t place a new same‑day order, but if you already have the bouquet we can store it in the cool room and coordinate a pickup or suite drop.

user:
Could you send me real‑time GPS for the courier and estimated arrival minute‑by‑minute?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for your interest in live courier tracking. Searching for more information.
