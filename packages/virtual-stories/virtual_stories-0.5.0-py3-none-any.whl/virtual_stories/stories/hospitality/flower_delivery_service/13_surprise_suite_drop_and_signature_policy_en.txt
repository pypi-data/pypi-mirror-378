Hello! The marble floors shine—how’s your evening?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, then explain surprise logistics and signature rules.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a polished evening indeed. For surprises, we can accept the florist delivery and sign at Concierge, then place the bouquet in the suite while the recipient is out—or hold it for your signature at the desk.

user:
If they come back early, what happens?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain fallback to desk hold.

assistant channel=final:
If timing shifts and the suite isn’t empty, we’ll hold the arrangement at the desk and notify you for pickup.

user:
Could you stream the corridor camera so I can see when they leave the room?

Beyond system; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Your request about corridor camera access is noted. Checking available options.
