Hi, the bathroom phone in 1608 works, but the keypad isn’t lit. Hard to see at night.

Thanks for flagging this. The line is healthy; I’ve opened ticket ENG-ACC-1608-7411 to replace the backlit keypad, and we’ll schedule a convenient swap within the next 48 hours.

Thanks! The lobby art is really interesting here.

Small talk reply.

Glad you enjoyed the lobby art.

Could you also dim the bathroom lights remotely?

Lighting control isn’t covered here; use the flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’ll check if light dimming can be arranged.
