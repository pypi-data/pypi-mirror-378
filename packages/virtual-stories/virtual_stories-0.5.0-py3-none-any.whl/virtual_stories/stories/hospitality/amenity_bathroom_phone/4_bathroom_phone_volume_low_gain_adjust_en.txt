Hello—on 1112, the bathroom phone is super quiet. I can barely hear you.

assistant channel=analysis:
Run test, then increase RX gain a bit and confirm.

assistant channel=final:
I’ve boosted the receive volume on the bathroom handset in 1112 by +3 dB. Please try a quick call now—voices should be much clearer without echo.

user:
Much better—thank you! The spa music in the hallway is relaxing.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgment only.

assistant channel=final:
Glad it’s feeling more comfortable now.

user:
Could you forward my calls to my mobile later tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Call forwarding isn’t within this system scope.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I can check what’s possible for call forwarding.
