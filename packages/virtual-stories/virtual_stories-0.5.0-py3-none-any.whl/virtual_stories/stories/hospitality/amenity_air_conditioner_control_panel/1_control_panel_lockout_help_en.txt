Desert Dunes Resort (hotel_id: ddr_scottsdale)
Location: 7350 E Camelback Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85251
Time zone: America/Phoenix

Control Panel Policy:
1) Child Lock may engage after prolonged button holds.
2) Unlock requires the last four digits of the registered phone number.
3) Three failed attempts cause a 10-minute lockout.
4) Engineering hours 07:00–22:00; overnight security can assist with access logging.

user:
Hi, my wall panel in room 512 says “LOCKED” and none of the buttons respond. Can you unlock it?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check current panel status, then request verification code and perform unlock.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_panel_status:
{"room_number":"512"}

tool.get_panel_status channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"room_number":"512","locked":true,"lock_reason":"child_lock","failed_attempts":0}

assistant channel=final:
I can unlock that for you. For verification, what are the last four digits of the phone number on your reservation?

user:
It should be 7712.

assistant channel=analysis:
Attempt panel unlock with code 7712.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.unlock_panel:
{"room_number":"512","verification_code":"7712"}

tool.unlock_panel channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"unlocked":true,"attempts_used":1}

assistant channel=final:
All set—the panel in 512 is now unlocked. You can adjust temperature and fan normally. If it relocks or shows an error, I can open an engineering ticket.

user:
Thanks! Also, those desert sunsets look incredible from the pool.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk about resort setting—no tool needed.

assistant channel=final:
The pool deck here is known for wide, colorful sunsets.

user:
While I have you, could you extend my checkout to 4 PM?

assistant channel=analysis:
Not covered by tools or system scope; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Understood. Reviewing available resources.
