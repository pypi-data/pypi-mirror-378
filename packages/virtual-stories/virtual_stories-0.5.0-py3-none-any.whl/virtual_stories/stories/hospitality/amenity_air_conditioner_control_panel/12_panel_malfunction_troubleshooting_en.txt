user:
Can you tell me what's causing these technical problems? Is it the salt air or something else?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the technical causes of the panel malfunctions. The system prompt specifically mentions environmental factors including salt air corrosion protection, humidity sensors, and UV-resistant display coating as relevant technical specifications.

assistant channel=final:
The salt air environment here can definitely impact electronic systems, which is why our panels have salt air corrosion protection and UV-resistant display coating. However, the issues you're experiencing could also be related to humidity sensors, electrical surge protection systems, or the capacitive touchscreen sensors. Our diagnostic system can identify the specific cause.

user:
Is there a way to prevent this from happening to other guests?
