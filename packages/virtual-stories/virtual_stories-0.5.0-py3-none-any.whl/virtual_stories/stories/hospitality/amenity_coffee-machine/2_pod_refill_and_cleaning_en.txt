Hi there—could I get two more dark roast pods sent up to room 512?

user:
Thanks! By the way, the view is gorgeous tonight.

assistant channel=analysis:
Respond with a light comment; no tools.

assistant channel=final:
It’s one of our favorite riverfront sunsets—glad you’re enjoying it.

user:
Do I need to do anything special to clean the machine myself?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from system: cleaning tablets are available; routine descaling schedule noted.

assistant channel=final:
You can run a quick rinse and, if you’d like, we can send cleaning tablets—housekeeping also descales every 14 days, so no charge either way.

user:
Any recommendations for historic coffee houses around here?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope for hotel amenity tools/knowledge.
