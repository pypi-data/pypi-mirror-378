I spilled coffee during brew in room 2711. Can you help me clean it up?

Offer guidance and send cleaning tablets; towels are part of housekeeping but not defined as a tool—avoid promising towels unless covered; stick to tablets.

I’m sending a cleaning tablet (ETA ~13 minutes). Seat the drip tray, run a rinse cycle, then wipe the area—this usually clears brew spills.

user:
Good to know. The rooftop garden sounds nice.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a peaceful spot from 08:00 to 20:00.
