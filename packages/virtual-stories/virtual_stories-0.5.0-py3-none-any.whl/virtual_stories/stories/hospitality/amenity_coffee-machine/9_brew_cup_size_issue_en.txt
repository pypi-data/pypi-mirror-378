My Vertuo in 604 only makes a tiny shot. How do I get a bigger cup?

assistant channel=analysis:
Advise from system: use larger-cup varieties; offer to send Medium Roast.

assistant channel=final:
Use a larger-cup capsule like Medium Roast—the machine reads the barcode to size the brew. Want me to send a couple to 604?

user:
Yes, send 2 Medium Roast.
