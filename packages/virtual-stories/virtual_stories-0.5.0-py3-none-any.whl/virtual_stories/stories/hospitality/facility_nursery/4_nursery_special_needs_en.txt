That sounds wonderful! My son is mostly non-verbal and can get overwhelmed by loud noises and bright lights. He also needs help with transitions between activities. How do you handle these situations?

The parent is providing specific details about their son's needs: non-verbal communication, sensory sensitivities to noise and light, and transition difficulties. This information is covered in our system context about environmental adaptations and communication support. I should provide detailed information about how we address these specific challenges.

The parent is asking about social interaction programs for children with autism. This information is covered in our system context about specialized programs and social skills development. I should provide detailed information about our social skills programs and peer interaction opportunities.

Would you like to include social skills goals in his individualized accommodation plan?
