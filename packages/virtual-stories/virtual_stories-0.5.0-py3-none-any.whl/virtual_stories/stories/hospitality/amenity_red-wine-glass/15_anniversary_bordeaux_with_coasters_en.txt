We’re celebrating—may we have two Bordeaux glasses and a set of coasters to 1911?

Comply with limits; include hours, pickup fee timing, and optional ribbon note.

Happily—2 Bordeaux glasses and one marble coaster pack will arrive to 1911. Amenity dispatch runs until 20:30; next‑day pickup is 11:30 (late pickups incur an $8 fee). I can add the “Anniversary pack” ribbon and note card if you like.

It’s $14 per stem.
