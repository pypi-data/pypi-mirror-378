Tour includes secret beach coves, wildflower meadows, and our iconic infinity pool. $85/hour ($425 total). Meet at the infinity pool deck - ideal timing for sunset golden hour!

The infinity pool looks amazing in your hotel photos!

This is a casual comment about the hotel's infinity pool, which is mentioned as a meeting point and scenic feature.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! The infinity pool deck is actually one of our most photographed spots - it creates stunning layered shots with the ocean horizon. Alex will show you the best angles for both day and golden hour lighting.
