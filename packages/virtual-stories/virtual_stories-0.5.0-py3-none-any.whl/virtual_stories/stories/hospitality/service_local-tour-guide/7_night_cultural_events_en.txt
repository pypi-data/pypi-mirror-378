Perfect timing - 7 PM start allows for multiple venue visits including Preservation Hall at 8 PM with VIP seating, then Blue Note and Tipitina's later. 5 hours at $80/hour = $400 plus event tickets.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! I've booked a 5-hour authentic music and nightlife tour starting 7 PM tomorrow (guide #7744). Includes VIP seating at legendary Preservation Hall (8 PM traditional jazz), Blue Note for contemporary jazz (9:30 PM), and Tipitina's for local bands (10 PM), plus French Quarter street musicians. $80/hour ($400) plus event tickets. Meet at our lobby bar!

The lobby piano music is beautiful right now.

Thank you! Our lobby pianist plays nightly from 6-9 PM, featuring classic jazz standards and some original compositions. It's a perfect warm-up for tomorrow night's tour through the city's incredible music scene.
