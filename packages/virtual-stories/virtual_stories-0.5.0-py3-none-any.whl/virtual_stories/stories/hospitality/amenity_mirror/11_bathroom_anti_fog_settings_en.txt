user:
How do I turn on the anti-fog on the bathroom mirror?

assistant channel=final:
Tap the wave icon on the mirror to activate the demister—it warms the glass to about 38°C and auto-turns off in 20 minutes. Long-press the same icon for a 40-minute cycle. If you’d like, Housekeeping can enable it for you on demand.

user:
Thanks! The lighting feels crisp this morning.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgement only.

assistant channel=final:
Glad to hear it—the backlight remembers your last color temp and brightness.
