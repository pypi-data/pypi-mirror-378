Answer dimmer range and outage behavior; suggest loaner clip-on. Keep tight.

Can I dim the vanity light? What happens if the power blips?

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the vanity light dims from 5% to 100% and supports 3200K, 4500K, and 5600K. During an outage it turns off—there’s no internal battery—but we can loan a clip-on light that works with a power bank.

user:
Appreciate it. The runway views are fun to watch.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
Glad you’re enjoying them—power resumes with your last mirror setting saved.

user:
Can you dim the bathroom sconces independently?

assistant channel=analysis:
Not in system—flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Separate sconce control isn’t listed. Checking available options.
