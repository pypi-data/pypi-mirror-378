Hi! My skirt hem is coming down. I’m in 1210—could I get hem tape and a needle?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check basic kit availability for floor 12; then arrange kit delivery; include safety reminder per system.

{"available":true,"kit_contents":["hem_tape","white_thread","black_thread","needle","safety_pins"],"eta_minutes":14}

Arrange delivery and communicate safety advisory about hem tape on silk.

{"service_arranged":true,"delivery_time":"14_minutes","assistance_offered":true}

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—I’ll send a kit with hem tape, needle, and thread to 1210; it should arrive in about 14 minutes. If your skirt is silk, avoid keeping hem tape on for more than 6 hours.
