user:
We’d like a nap-friendly cabana tomorrow, ideally quiet and shaded. Can we get outlets too?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm amenities and quiet guidance.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—each cabana includes a shade canopy, two power outlets, and we can add a mini-fan. We recommend the 13:00–15:00 quiet window for naps. Towel refresh runs every two hours.

user:
Nice. If it rains, do we lose the booking?

assistant channel=analysis:
Rain policy details.

assistant channel=final:
If there’s a lightning alert, we’ll reschedule without a fee. Otherwise, we can move you under a tent cover on a first-come basis.

user:
Out of curiosity, could you share your full pool deck CAD with drainage gradients so we can plan stroller placement?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond guide; escalate and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking. The request for deck layout CAD and drainage details is being processed now.
