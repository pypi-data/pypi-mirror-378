Could you remove the bed skirt in 1909? I prefer a minimalist look.

Absolutely—we’ll remove the bed skirt, clean the base, and store the piece for your stay. Grace is scheduled for 4:15 PM and your no‑skirt preference is saved.

user:
Thanks. The room feels warm but uncluttered.

assistant channel=analysis:
Chitchat aligning to ambience.

assistant channel=final:
That’s the intent—warm lighting with clean lines keeps the space calm.

user:
Will the base look finished without the skirt?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from Article 1.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the upholstered base panels are designed to look finished even without a skirt.

user:
Do you know if the closest food hall has live music tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Acknowledged. Reviewing available resources.

Great, thanks.
