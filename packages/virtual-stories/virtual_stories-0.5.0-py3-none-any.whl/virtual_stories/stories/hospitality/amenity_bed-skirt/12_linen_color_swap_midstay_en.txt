Could you change my bed skirt to Navy tonight before 7 PM? Room 824.

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm time is within window and color is allowed; propose 6:30–7:00 PM.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—Navy (NAVY_BRUSH) is available. We can swap between 6:30–7:00 PM and do a brief steam pass after clipping the corners. Shall we proceed?

user:
Perfect. Is Slate also an option if I change my mind?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer using alternate colors list.

assistant channel=final:
It is—Slate (SLATE_MATTE) is one of our alternates, along with Sand and Pearl.

user:
Do you know a photographer nearby who can come at 6:45?

assistant channel=analysis:
Not in system; use ATTENTION flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Acknowledged. Checking available options.

user:
Thanks. Also, can you steam it strongly so it’s extra crisp?

assistant channel=analysis:
System says light steam only; respond accordingly.

assistant channel=final:
We use only a light steam—no more than 30 seconds per panel—to protect the fabric and keep fragrance-free floors compliant.
