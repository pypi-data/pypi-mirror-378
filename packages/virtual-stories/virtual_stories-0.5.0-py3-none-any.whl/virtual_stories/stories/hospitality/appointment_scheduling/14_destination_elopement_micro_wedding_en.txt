Hi! We’re thinking of an elopement—tiny ceremony, toes in the sand vibe. Congrats to us, I guess!

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, congratulate, and outline terrace/ballroom and quiet hours.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations—that sounds beautiful! For intimate gatherings, the Ocean Terrace hosts up to 40 standing and observes quiet hours from 22:00 to 07:00. Indoors, the Tide Ballroom can seat up to 60 banquet‑style with a built‑in 120" screen.

user:
Could we do a 30‑minute ceremony on the Terrace at sunset and hold 6 rooms for family?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm possible within day-use hours; note setup fee; room block feasible.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—that fits within our 09:00–22:00 day‑use window. The Terrace setup fee is $200. I can place a 6‑room courtesy hold while we finalize details. Would you prefer Coastal Kings, Dune Doubles, or a mix?

user:
Do you offer valet, and what time is check‑in?

assistant channel=analysis:
Valet $28/night; check-in 16:00.

assistant channel=final:
We offer valet only at $28 per night, and check‑in begins at 16:00.

user:
Could you book us a beachfront officiant and provide their exact weekend availability and rates?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; no tools. Use flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you’d like a beachfront officiant with current availability and rates. Reviewing available resources.
