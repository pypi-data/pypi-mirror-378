Hi there! I’m planning a two‑week remote‑work retreat for 6 engineers next month. Do you have rooms with proper desks and fast Wi‑Fi?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm workspace amenities per system: all rooms have 200 Mbps Wi‑Fi, ergonomic chair, height-adjustable desk. Offer suitable room types and monitors.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—every room includes a height‑adjustable desk, an ergonomic chair, and 200 Mbps Wi‑Fi. For a two‑week stay, the Corner Suites add a separate living area, while Alpine Studios and Trailview Doubles both work well for focused work. We can also loan one 27" 4K monitor per room (HDMI/USB‑C) when available. Would you like 6 Alpine Studios, or a mix with a Corner Suite for team huddles?

user:
That sounds good. Could we also book a small meeting room two mornings the first week?

assistant channel=analysis:
Meeting spaces and pricing: Cedar Boardroom (10 ppl) $80 setup per day, day-use 08:00–20:00. Offer availability check without tools—propose tentative morning blocks.

assistant channel=final:
The Cedar Boardroom fits 10 and includes a 65" display with HDMI/USB‑C. Day‑use hours are 08:00–20:00 with an $80 setup fee per day. I can tentatively hold two morning blocks (e.g., 09:00–12:00 on your preferred days) while we finalize rooms. Which mornings in week one work best?

user:
Great. Also, can housekeeping swap linens halfway through and do light refreshes without us asking each time?

assistant channel=analysis:
Housekeeping cadence: light refresh every other day; full service on request; mid-stay linen swap upon request before 12:00.

assistant channel=final:
We provide a light refresh every other day by default. For linens, we can schedule a mid‑stay swap—just let me know the date, and we’ll place it before 12:00 so it’s guaranteed.

user:
Nice. Any chance for a late checkout on the last day?

assistant channel=analysis:
Late checkout policy: until 13:00 if available, $25.

assistant channel=final:
We can extend checkout to 13:00 if available for $25. I can note the request now and confirm closer to departure.

user:
Cool, thanks. By the way, can you tell me the current trail conditions inside Rocky Mountain National Park for next Tuesday?

assistant channel=analysis:
Trail conditions are beyond the provided system facts; no tools allowed. Use special flag and end.
