That sounds wonderful! Could you recommend a good place for aperitivo near here? Something authentic Italian?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking for aperitivo recommendations. I can provide this information based on hotel knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! I'd recommend Il Salumaio right around the corner—they serve exquisite aperitivo with local wines and traditional Italian charcuterie. It's a favorite among fashion insiders and offers the perfect pre-dinner atmosphere with people-watching on the fashion street.
