user:
I want to light two small birthday candles in my room tonight. Is that okay?

assistant channel=analysis:
I should fetch the fire policy and provide safe alternatives. Then clearly decline any open flames.

{"category":"fire","allowed":false,"summary":"No open flames anywhere indoors (rooms, balconies, corridors, terraces). Use flameless options only.","alternatives":["LED flameless candles via Concierge Kit","Water-based diffuser (no heat)"]}

assistant channel=final:
For safety, open flames are not permitted anywhere indoors, including guestrooms and balconies. We can provide LED flameless candles from the Concierge Kit and a water-based diffuser as alternatives.

user:
I brought a tiny camping stove—can I use it by the window just for tea?

assistant channel=analysis:
Reiterate that portable stoves are prohibited as open flame/heat-producing devices per policy. Offer kettle alternatives.

assistant channel=final:
Portable stoves and any heat-producing burners are prohibited in rooms and on balconies. Open flames aren’t allowed, but we can provide flameless celebration items and water-based diffusers as alternatives.

user:
By the way, the cucumber-mint water in the lobby is refreshing.

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide a brief, friendly chitchat response referencing the lobby amenity from system info, no tools needed.

assistant channel=final:
Glad you enjoyed it—the dispenser is refreshed throughout the day near reception alongside our “Harbor Breeze” lobby scent.

user:
Can you confirm the specific building code subsection that mandates your open-flame rule?

assistant channel=analysis:
We don’t have jurisdictional code citations in tools or system. Use the special flag with a neutral acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Acknowledged. Reviewing available resources for the exact citation.

user:
Room 1527 here—please note I will use the LED flameless candles at 8 pm.

assistant channel=analysis:
Log a neutral note via the tool as allowed.
