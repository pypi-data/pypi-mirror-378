It's our 25th anniversary and we brought some beautiful sparklers to celebrate on our balcony tonight. Are those okay to use?

assistant channel=analysis:
I need to check the fire policy since sparklers are open flame/sparking devices. Then offer romantic alternatives for their special anniversary celebration.

Congratulations on your 25th anniversary! Unfortunately, sparklers and all spark-producing items are prohibited throughout the property, including balconies, for fire safety. Our Romance Concierge can arrange LED string lights, battery-operated candles, and custom lighting for a magical celebration instead.

We have wonderful anniversary packages! Private champagne service, personalized dessert presentations, rose petal arrangements, and our sunset viewing deck with supervised beach bonfire permits. Our Romance Concierge specializes in creating unforgettable milestone celebrations.

user:
Your oceanview infinity pool looked stunning at sunset yesterday.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! The infinity pool deck offers incredible sunset views - it's actually one of our most popular spots for anniversary celebrations, especially with our "Coastal Breeze" scent and evening turndown service with chocolates.

user:
What specific fire code regulation number prohibits sparklers on private balconies in this jurisdiction?

assistant channel=analysis:
This asks for specific fire code citations and regulation numbers, which isn't available in our system information or tools.
