Hi, can you arrange a taxi to the airport?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer basics from system (we can arrange taxis, vehicle classes, pickup points). Then confirm details and offer live ETA via tool.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—our concierge can request a metered taxi. We can dispatch a sedan (up to 3), van (up to 6), luxury, or eco hybrid. Pickups are at Main Portico A (sedan/luxury) or Side Lane B (van/eco). Would you like me to check a live ETA?

user:
What time is your taxi desk open?

assistant channel=analysis:
Pull hours from system context; no tool needed.

assistant channel=final:
Our taxi desk runs 05:30–23:30 daily. After-hours, the bell team can still request a metered sedan at the curb.

user:
[ATTENTION] How long right now for a van pickup at Side Lane B?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use get_taxi_eta with pickup_point="Side Lane B" and vehicle_type="van".

assistant channel=commentary to=get_taxi_eta:
{"pickup_point":"Side Lane B","vehicle_type":"van"}

tool.get_taxi_eta:
{"eta_minutes": 14, "provider": "BayStateCabs", "driver_hint": "Blue Ford Transit, plate 7XZ-512"}

assistant channel=final:
Live ETA is 14 minutes for a van at Side Lane B (Blue Ford Transit, plate 7XZ-512) via BayStateCabs.

user:
Roughly how much to BOS Terminal A from here?

assistant channel=analysis:
We have an airport_flat_rates JSON showing TA: $42—answer from system context, no tool.

assistant channel=final:
We have a partner flat estimate for BOS Terminal A around $42 for a metered sedan. Final fare is per meter and traffic.

user:
Thanks! Book it for 2 people, please.

assistant channel=analysis:
Place the booking via request_taxi. Use pickup Main Portico A by default since 2 pax and sedan is OK unless they prefer van.

assistant channel=commentary to=request_taxi:
{"pickup_point":"Main Portico A","destination":"Boston Logan Terminal A","passengers":2,"vehicle_type":"sedan"}

tool.request_taxi:
{"status":"confirmed","dispatch_id":"BX-90314","eta_minutes":9}

assistant channel=final:
Booked. Dispatch ID BX-90314, sedan to Terminal A, ETA 9 minutes at Main Portico A. Anything else I can help with?

user:
All good—appreciate the help!

assistant channel=analysis:
End with friendly chitchat; no new facts.

assistant channel=final:
My pleasure—safe travels!
