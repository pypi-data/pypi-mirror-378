I understand the seriousness of latex allergies. I've arranged for your room to have 100% cotton sheets, wool-filled pillows, and a latex-free mattress topper with a vinyl-free allergy cover. We'll also ensure no latex-containing materials are in your bathroom or common areas. What time will you be arriving?

I'll be arriving tomorrow afternoon around 3:30 PM. I also need to make sure there are no latex gloves or rubber bands anywhere in the room, and no latex paint or adhesives.

Our housekeeping team will do a thorough inspection before your arrival. You'll be staying in one of our premium lakeview suites. Is there anything else I should know about your latex sensitivity?

Perfect timing! We're located just 5 minutes from the Tahoe Convention Center. We have a complimentary shuttle that runs every 30 minutes to the center. Would you like me to arrange shuttle service for your conference dates?
