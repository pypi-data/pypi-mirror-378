Hi! I'm staying at Mountain View Grand next week and I have severe food allergies. I'm allergic to nuts, shellfish, and dairy. I need to know about your dining options and how you handle cross-contamination.

Hello! Welcome to Mountain View Grand Hotel & Resort. We take food allergies very seriously and have a comprehensive allergy program. We have dedicated allergen-free prep stations, separate cooking equipment for eight major allergens, and all staff are trained in cross-contamination prevention. Our four restaurants can accommodate nut, shellfish, and dairy allergies with extensive menu modifications. Could you tell me more about your specific allergies or if there are any particular dishes you'd like to enjoy?

user:
That's very reassuring! I'm especially concerned about cross-contamination since even trace amounts can cause serious reactions. Do you have separate fryers and prep areas? Also, I'm wondering about your "Rustic Cabin" restaurant—I love comfort food but need to avoid all dairy.

The guest is asking about specific cross-contamination prevention measures which are covered in the system prompt. I should explain our protocols and offer specific accommodations.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely, we understand how serious cross-contamination can be. We have completely separate fryers, prep areas, and cooking equipment for allergen-free preparation. Our Rustic Cabin restaurant specializes in hearty American comfort food and we can modify all dishes to be completely dairy-free. For example, we can prepare our famous mac and cheese with dairy-free alternatives or create custom dairy-free versions of our comfort classics. Would you like me to note any specific dishes you're interested in?

user:
That sounds great! Could you tell me about the ingredients in your house salad dressing and if you have dairy-free options? I'm also curious about your bread—does it contain dairy?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about specific ingredients in salad dressing and bread. While I know we have dairy-free options, the exact ingredients and formulations are specific details not covered in the system prompt. I need to acknowledge this and pass it to background processing.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Those are excellent questions about our specific ingredients and formulations. I don't have the detailed ingredient lists and exact formulations for our house salad dressing and bread right now. I'm looking into this.

user:
I appreciate you checking on that. By the way, I noticed your resort is in Aspen—have you ever skied the famous runs there? I've heard the mountain views are incredible.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is making small talk about skiing in Aspen. This is a local activity question that's beyond the hotel's system information. I should acknowledge this and pass it to background processing while keeping the conversation friendly.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Aspen is indeed spectacular for skiing! The mountain views from our property are breathtaking, especially from our Summit Fine Dining restaurant. I don't have specific details about the ski runs right now. I'm looking into this.

user:
Thanks for that. One more thing—do you have information about local hiking trails that are allergen-friendly? I want to avoid areas with lots of pine pollen.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about local hiking trails and pollen information. This is specific local environmental information not covered in the hotel's system prompt. I need to acknowledge this and pass it to background processing.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a great question about allergen-friendly hiking trails and pollen patterns in the area. I don't have that specific local environmental information right now. I'm looking into this.

user:
You've been so helpful. I feel much better prepared for my trip now. What's the best time to arrive for dinner reservations?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about dinner reservation timing. This is general hotel information that's covered in our standard operating hours, but specific availability would require checking current reservations which is beyond my system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] You're very welcome! For the best dinner experience, we recommend making reservations by 5:00 PM for our popular restaurants. I don't have the specific availability for your dates right now. I'm looking into this.

user:
Perfect! Thank you for all your assistance. I can't wait to experience Mountain View Grand.
