user:
Hi, I need to cancel my spa appointment for tomorrow. It's booking ID SPA-HKG-2234. What's your cancellation policy?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide cancellation policy information from system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
I can help with that. Our cancellation policy is free cancellation up to 24 hours before your appointment, 50% charge for cancellations within 24 hours, and no refund for no-shows. Since your appointment is tomorrow, there would be a 50% charge. However, we also allow rescheduling with 4-hour notice if you'd prefer to move your appointment instead.

user:
Actually, rescheduling sounds better. What availability do you have this weekend?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check weekend hours to provide availability information.

Provide weekend hours and suggest they contact for specific time slots.

assistant channel=final:
Great choice! Our weekend hours are 09:00–22:00, so we have good availability. For specific time slots and to complete the rescheduling, I'd recommend calling our spa reception directly at the number provided in your booking confirmation, or you can visit us on Level B1.

user:
Perfect, I'll call them. The 4-hour notice requirement is very reasonable.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge their comment about the policy without adding new information.

assistant channel=final:
We try to be flexible while ensuring we can accommodate all our guests. The 4-hour notice helps us manage our schedule effectively.

user:
Do you have any special promotions running this month?

assistant channel=analysis:
Special promotions aren't mentioned in system prompt, so use attention flag.

[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking. Checking available options.
