TTR benefits: Current tier includes 14:00 late checkout subject to availability; Crest includes guaranteed 16:00 late checkout except during citywide event blackouts; Horizon late checkout at 16:00 is guaranteed even during events. Blackout weeks reduce guarantee to priority consideration for lower tiers. Loyalty desk hours 09:00–19:00.

Horizon remains guaranteed.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—Horizon keeps a guaranteed 16:00 late checkout even during event blackouts.
