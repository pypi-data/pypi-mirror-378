Hey there! Beautiful day, isn't it? I need some navy polish for my loafers.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is being friendly and chatty about the weather. They need navy polish which we have. I should match their casual tone and acknowledge the lovely weather.

assistant channel=final:
It really is gorgeous! Perfect Miami Beach weather - sunny and 82 degrees with that nice ocean breeze. I'll get navy blue polish sent to your room right away. Are you planning to head out to the beach later?

user:
Absolutely! Planning to walk along the shore after I get these shoes looking sharp.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is being casual and sharing their plans. I can continue the friendly conversation while ensuring they get their polish service. I can mention our beachfront access and maybe the sunset viewing.

assistant channel=final:
That sounds perfect! Our navy polish with conditioning agents will have your loafers looking fantastic for that shore walk. We have private beach access, and don't miss the sunset from our rooftop deck around 6:45 PM - the view is incredible!

user:
Sounds lovely. Any good seafood recommendations for dinner?

assistant channel=analysis:
This question is about our dining options which I have information about in the system prompt. I can recommend our Oceanview Restaurant and mention the chef's special.

assistant channel=final:
Our Oceanview Restaurant serves amazing fresh seafood right here at the resort! Tonight's chef's special is grilled mahi-mahi with mango salsa - it's fantastic. Plus you'll have the ocean view while you dine.

user:
Do you know anything about surfing conditions tomorrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
Surfing conditions are beyond my available information about weather and resort services. This falls outside the system knowledge I have access to.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I acknowledge your question about surfing conditions. Looking into this for you.
