That sounds perfect. He sometimes gets overwhelmed by loud noises and needs a structured routine.

The weather is so nice here in Miami Beach.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk about the location and weather.

assistant channel=final:
It really is beautiful! The ocean breeze makes it perfect for outdoor activities when the children are ready for them.

user:
Do you have any outdoor sensory activities for autistic children?

assistant channel=analysis:
Asking about outdoor sensory programs - this goes beyond my specific tools but relates to special needs programming. I should flag for specialized information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a wonderful question about our outdoor sensory programming. Looking into available resources.
