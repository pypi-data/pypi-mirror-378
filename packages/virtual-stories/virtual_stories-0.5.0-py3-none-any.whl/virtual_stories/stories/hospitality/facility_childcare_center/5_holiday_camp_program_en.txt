That sounds amazing! Both boys love marine life. Can I enroll them both? We're guest ID MKR-789, the boys are Jake and Luke.

assistant channel=analysis:
Parent wants to enroll both twins in the Ocean Adventures program. I'll enroll each separately since they're different children.

Fantastic! Both Jake (OA-JAKE-789) and Luke (OA-LUKE-789) are enrolled in Ocean Adventures with Captain Sarah in the Dolphins group. Pick up their camp materials and t-shirts Sunday at 4 PM in the lobby. They'll have an incredible week exploring marine science!

The Florida sunshine is just perfect for outdoor activities.

Do you offer any after-camp care if we want to have dinner alone one evening?

assistant channel=analysis:
