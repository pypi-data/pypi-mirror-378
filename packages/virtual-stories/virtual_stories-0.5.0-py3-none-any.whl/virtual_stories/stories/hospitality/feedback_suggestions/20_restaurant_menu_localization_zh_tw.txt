我對台灣的茶文化很感興趣，你們有沒有茶葉品嚐或製作的活動？

The guest is interested in Taiwanese tea culture and asking about tea tasting or production activities. Our system prompt mentions tea plantations surrounding the hotel and traditional Taiwanese breakfast with home-grown produce, but doesn't specifically mention tea tasting or production activities. This goes beyond the information available in our system prompt.

[ATTENTION] 這是個很有深度的问题。讓我為您查詢相關的茶文化活動。
