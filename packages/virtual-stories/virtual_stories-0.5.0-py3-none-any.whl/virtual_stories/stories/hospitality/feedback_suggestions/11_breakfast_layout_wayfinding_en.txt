Good morning! Lovely view up here. By the way, the croissants are dangerously good. I did notice people circling for plates—felt a bit confusing. Could I share a quick suggestion?

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge small talk, invite feedback, mention current plate station locations and QR feedback option.

assistant channel=final:
Good morning—and thank you for the croissant praise! I'd love to hear your suggestion. For context, plates are currently stacked at the fruit/salad island on Coral Terrace, and we restock every 15 minutes. If you'd like, the table tent QR also goes straight to our feedback form.

user:
Thanks! Would it help to put a plate stack near the omelet station? Also, what time does the barista bar close on weekends?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer barista bar hours from system prompt; acknowledge the plate idea and note where to log it.

assistant channel=final:
Great ideas—I'll capture the omelet-station plate stack for our F&B stewarding team. On weekends, the barista bar runs 07:00–11:00 alongside the breakfast service on Level 2.

user:
Could you also share last month’s guest satisfaction heatmap by time-of-morning for Coral Terrace so I can compare peak times?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is beyond the system facts provided. Use the special flag and conclude.
