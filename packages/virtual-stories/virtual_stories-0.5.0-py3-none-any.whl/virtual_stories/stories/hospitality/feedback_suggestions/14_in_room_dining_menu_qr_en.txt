Hi! The welcome screen animation is calming. Re the QR menu: the icons are tiny—could there be a larger text label toggle?

assistant channel=analysis:
Thank, state current legend and dark mode; agree to log suggestion.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—we’ll share that with our design team. The allergen legend is on page one, and there’s a dark mode today. I’ll submit a request for a larger text label toggle on the QR menu.

user:
Is the overnight menu only cold items?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from facts: overnight cold menu 23:00–06:00.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—overnight from 23:00 to 06:00 we offer a cold menu only. Daytime hot items run 06:00 to 23:00.

Could you share the A/B test results for the iconography update with click‑through rates and repeat orders?

Beyond facts—use special flag.
