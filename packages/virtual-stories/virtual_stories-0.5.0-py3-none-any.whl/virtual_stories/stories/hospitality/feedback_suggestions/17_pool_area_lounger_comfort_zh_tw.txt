嗨！我在泳池區躺了一下午，覺得躺椅的軟墊有點薄，可以換厚一點的嗎？

我們的泳池水溫維持在28°C，使用鹽水系統對皮膚更溫和。關於遮陽，我們提供可以租用的遮陽涼亭，讓您可以在泳池區享受舒適的休息時光。

那你們有沒有提供海上活動的課程？比如風帆或衝浪？

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about water sports lessons like sailing or surfing. Our system prompt mentions complimentary kayaking and paddleboarding lessons, but doesn't mention sailing or surfing specifically. This goes beyond the information available in our system prompt.

[ATTENTION] 這是個很好的問題。讓我為您確認可用的水上活動選項。
