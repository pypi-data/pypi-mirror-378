那你們有沒有提供人工智慧或機器學習相關的工作坊？我想了解科技園區的最新發展。

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about AI or machine learning workshops and wants to know about the latest developments in the science park. Our system prompt mentions partnership with local tech companies for innovation workshops, but doesn't specify AI/ML workshops or detailed science park developments. This goes beyond the information I have access to.

[ATTENTION] 這是個很有趣的問題。讓我為您查詢相關的科技工作坊資訊。
