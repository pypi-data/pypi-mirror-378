Willow & Vine Family Suites (hotel_id: wvfs_atl_08)
Address: 122 Peachtree Center Ave, Atlanta, GA 30303
Timezone: America/New_York

Family Standards:
- Child‑safe accessories available on request: outlet covers, corner guards, lidded bins with locks.
- Preferred bathroom bin option: 7L lidded unit with toggle lock; magnetic locks available for extended stays.

Article One — Layout:
Family suites place bins away from the tub to reduce splash and reach, with space for step stools to remain clear of waste areas.

Article Two — Cleanliness:
Sanitization uses kid‑safe neutral cleaners; we replace inner caddies if hairline cracks are found.

Article Three — Comfort:
Soft night‑light glow guides midnight trips without waking the room.

Article Four — Service:
Accessories are staged by floor captains and delivered by runners within 20–25 minutes during coverage hours.

Article Five — Locale:
Downtown attractions are a short stroll; the lobby play nook keeps rainy days easy.

Great, thank you. The night‑light in the bathroom is a nice touch.

I’m glad it helps—those soft night‑lights are standard in our family suites.

Can you place the bin farther from the tub?

Answer based on layout guidance in system.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—we’ll position it away from the tub to keep splash and reach to a minimum.

Also, any idea where to rent a stroller nearby?
