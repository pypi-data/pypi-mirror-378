user:
Hi! I run hot when I sleep. Anything cooler you can send up?

assistant channel=analysis:
Propose buckwheat and breathable microfiber; mention spare pillowcases; small talk.

assistant channel=final:
We’ve got options to keep things breezy. Buckwheat hull pillows allow airflow and hold their shape, and our breathable microfiber stays light. I can send one of each with spare pillowcases so you can swap if needed. Delivery is 10–15 minutes. If you’d like, we can also pencil a quick linen refresh tomorrow afternoon.

user:
Send both. Could you also tell me the exact GSM of the pillowcases?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Great spec question. Checking available details.
