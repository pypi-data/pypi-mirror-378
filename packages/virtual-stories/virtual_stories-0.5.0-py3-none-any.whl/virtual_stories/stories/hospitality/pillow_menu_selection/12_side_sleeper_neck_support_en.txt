system:
Pillow Menu: medium microfiber, firm microfiber, memory foam contour, feather/down blend, body pillow.
Guidance: Side sleepers often prefer higher loft or a contour pillow; stacking two medium microfiber can emulate a firm height.
Delivery: 10–15 minutes.

user:
Hey there—side sleeper here. What do you recommend so I don’t wake up with a stiff neck?

assistant channel=analysis:
Recommend contour or higher loft; offer body pillow; include small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Side sleepers unite—we’ve got your neck. Most guests in your camp like the memory foam contour or a firm microfiber for extra loft. Another trick is stacking two medium microfiber to match your shoulder width. A body pillow can help keep your spine aligned, too. I can send a contour and a firm so you can test which feels best.

user:
Send the contour and the body pillow, please. How fast can you get them up?

assistant channel=analysis:
Give delivery time.

assistant channel=final:
We’ll bring them within about 10–15 minutes and place them with fresh protectors.

user:
Awesome. Also, what thread count are the sheets?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope unless provided; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Nice detail‑oriented question. Checking available information.
