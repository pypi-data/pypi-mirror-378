Good afternoon! I'm in room 1603 and I can't get the smart toilet app to connect. It keeps saying "connection failed."

Check the toilet status to see if there are connectivity issues, then try resetting the connectivity if needed.

The toilet is offline and connectivity is disconnected. I'll reset the connectivity to restore app functionality.

I've reset the connectivity for your smart toilet! The system should be back online in about 30 seconds. You can now try connecting to the app again - it should pair successfully now.
