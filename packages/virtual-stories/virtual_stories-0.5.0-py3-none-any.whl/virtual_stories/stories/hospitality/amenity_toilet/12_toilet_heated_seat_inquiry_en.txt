There's also a quick warm option for immediate comfort and a night mode that reduces heating during nighttime hours to conserve energy.

The ocean view from this room is absolutely spectacular.

Can you modify the heated seat to include massage functions or integrate it with smart home systems for remote temperature control?

The guest is asking about modifying the heated seat for massage functions or smart home integration, which goes beyond what's available in the system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since no tools or system knowledge covers seat modifications or smart home system integration.
