Hello! Do you have a non-greasy body lotion that’s allergy-safe? My skin is combination.

assistant channel=analysis:
List lightweight options for combination skin, then check allergen on a likely fit.

assistant channel=final:
Two good fits: Rainforest Breeze Hydro-Lotion (fast-absorbing, marked RF-SAFE) and Lotus Mist Light Lotion (sheer hydration). Any specific allergens I should avoid for you?

user:
Mostly fragrance. If RF-SAFE covers that, I’ll take one to room 1712 tonight.

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm RF_BREEZE is safe for fragrance and note delivery window.

assistant channel=final:
Great—Rainforest Breeze Hydro-Lotion is fragrance-free. Spa deliveries run 10:00–22:00; would you like it sent now or closer to 22:00?

user:
Now works, thanks! Also, those cool towels are lifesavers.

assistant channel=final:
Glad to hear—they’re refreshed hourly in the locker rooms.

user:
Any hawker centers open late nearby?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope—flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’ll check late-night hawker options for you.
