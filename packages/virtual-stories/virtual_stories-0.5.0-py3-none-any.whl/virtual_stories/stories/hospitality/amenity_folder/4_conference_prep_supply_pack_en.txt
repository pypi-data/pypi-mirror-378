Your collab table (CT-3) is reserved for 2 hours. We'll pre-stage 20 folders, two 1-inch binders, 2 packs of 8-tab dividers, and a sheet of labels about 25 minutes before start.

user:
Is the pre-staging complimentary?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from policy.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—pre-staging is complimentary. Only upgrading to 2" binders incurs a $3 fee.

Nice, the lakeside breeze is perfect today.

It is—our terrace level catches that cool lake wind.

Can you order 50 custom printed binders with logos by tomorrow?
