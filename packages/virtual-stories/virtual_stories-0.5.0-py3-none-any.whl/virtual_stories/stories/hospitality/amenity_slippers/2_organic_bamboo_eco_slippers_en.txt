Hi! We're a family of four staying in the Cecropia Suite. Do you have eco-friendly slippers? My kids are 10 and 12, and my husband and I need adult sizes.

assistant channel=analysis:
Check available sizes for family: kids S, adults likely M/L, then deliver appropriate quantities to their suite.

assistant channel=analysis:
Good stock. Kids need S, need to ask parent sizes for adults.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! Our organic bamboo fiber slippers are perfect for families. We have size S for your kids (ages 10-12). What sizes do you and your husband need—M or L?

user:
I need medium and he needs large. These are made by local artisans?
