Oh no! I just realized I forgot my contact lens case and solution at home. I'm wearing daily contacts but I brought some monthly ones as backup. Do you have anything that could help me out?

No worries at all! We have contact lens emergency kits available. I can offer you a Basic Kit with sterile case, saline solution, and eye drops, or our Premium Kit with a designer case, multi-purpose solution, comfort drops, and lens wipes. Both are complimentary for your stay. What's your room number, and which kit would work better for you?

user:
I'm in room 1247. The premium kit sounds great! Could you have it sent up? Also, just curious - what's the weather supposed to be like tomorrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest in room 1247 wants the premium contact lens kit delivered to their room. They also ask about weather, which isn't part of my contact lens amenity services. I'll arrange the kit delivery first, then use the special flag for the weather question.
