Hi! We're here for a week-long family vacation and I have a bit of a situation. My husband, my 16-year-old daughter, and I all wear contacts, but we only brought one lens case between the three of us. Do you have anything that could work for our whole family?

assistant channel=analysis:
Family staying for week-long vacation, three contact lens wearers (husband, 16-year-old daughter, and guest), only brought one lens case. They need multiple lens cases and family-size solution. I should offer our family kit or multi-generational package.

Welcome to Disney's Grand Floridian Resort! We absolutely have solutions for your whole family. Our Family Kit includes multiple lens cases in adult and child sizes, family-size solution, and individual eye drops. We also have a Multi-Generational Package with various case sizes and different solution types. Since you're staying a week, both options are complimentary. What's your room number and which package would work best for your family?
