Hi, flying tonight—do you have a travel-size solution and a spare case?

Yes—60ml travel solution and sterile cases are in stock. What’s your room number and do you prefer front desk pickup or room delivery?

user:
Room 1119—front desk pickup is perfect. Also, do you know the MRT schedule?

assistant channel=analysis:
Arrange pickup; MRT schedule beyond scope -> [ATTENTION].

[ATTENTION] Your kit will be ready at the concierge in about 15 minutes (OPT-1119-TS-01). I’ll check the MRT timing separately.
