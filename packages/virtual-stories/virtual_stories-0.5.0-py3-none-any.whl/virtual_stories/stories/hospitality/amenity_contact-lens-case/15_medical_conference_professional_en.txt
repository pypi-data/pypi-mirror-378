Good morning! I'm here for the International Medical Conference and I have back-to-back sessions all day. I forgot my contact lens case and solution, and I'll be wearing my contacts for 12+ hours today. Do you have anything suitable for long conference days?

Medical professional attending International Medical Conference, back-to-back sessions all day, forgot contact lens case and solution, will wear contacts for 12+ hours. They need professional-grade products suitable for long wear. I should offer our medical kit or long-day kit.

Good morning! Welcome to the International Medical Conference. We have several professional options perfect for long conference days. Our Medical Kit includes sterile lens case, medical-grade saline solution, preservative-free drops, and sterile wipes.
