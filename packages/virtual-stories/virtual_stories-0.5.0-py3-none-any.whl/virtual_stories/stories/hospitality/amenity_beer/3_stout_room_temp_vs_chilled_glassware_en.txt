3) Glassware: Nonic pint for nitro; snifter for barrel‑aged.
4) Local options rotate weekly from Wisconsin breweries.
5) Delivery includes proper glassware and a short tasting note card.

I’m in 512—should I have the milk stout chilled or at cellar temp?

Verify age; fetch stout options; explain temps, then offer delivery.

For milk stouts, chilled brings a crisper finish, while cellar temp opens up aroma. Would you like the Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro delivered chilled with a Nonic pint?

user:
Yes, one Milk Stout chilled, please.

assistant channel=analysis:
Place chilled order with glassware note.

Great choice—your chilled Milk Stout is on its way with a Nonic pint, about 12 minutes.

user:
Also, the exposed brick in the halls is cool.

assistant channel=analysis:
Chit-chat.

assistant channel=final:
That brick-and-steel look has a lot of character.

user:
Can you send up whiskey as well?

assistant channel=analysis:
Spirits aren’t specified here; flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’ll check availability for a whiskey order.
