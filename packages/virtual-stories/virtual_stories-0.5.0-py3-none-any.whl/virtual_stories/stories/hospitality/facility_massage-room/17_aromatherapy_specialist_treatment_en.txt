I'm fascinated by aromatherapy! Do you create custom essential oil blends, and what therapeutic benefits do they offer?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is interested in aromatherapy and custom blends. I should explain our custom aromatherapy blends from the rooftop herb garden, the therapeutic benefits, and how we personalize treatments based on guest needs and stress patterns.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We specialize in custom aromatherapy blends using essential oils from our own rooftop herb garden. Our aromatherapy treatments are designed to address specific therapeutic needs - whether it's stress relief, muscle tension, or emotional balance. We use premium organic oils from local lavender farms in Provence, and our certified therapists create personalized blends based on your wellness consultation. The aromatherapy works in conjunction with our chromotherapy LED system and integrated music therapy featuring binaural beats for a truly holistic experience.

user:
That sounds amazing! What kinds of herbs do you grow in your rooftop garden?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about specific herbs in the rooftop garden. This detailed information about specific herbs isn't provided in my system prompt, so I should use the [ATTENTION] flag to indicate I need to search for more information about the herb garden contents.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for your interest in our herb garden details. Checking available resources.

user:
That's okay! Can you tell me more about how the aromatherapy works with the other treatments?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about how aromatherapy integrates with other treatments. I can explain how it works with chromotherapy, music therapy, and the overall wellness experience based on the system prompt information.

assistant channel=final:
The aromatherapy integrates beautifully with our other treatments! Our air purification system with HEPA filters includes essential oil diffusion, so the therapeutic scents are continuously circulated throughout your session. The aromatherapy works synergistically with our chromotherapy LED lighting system - different essential oils are paired with specific color therapy programs for enhanced therapeutic effects. Combined with our integrated music therapy featuring binaural beats and nature sounds, it creates a multi-sensory healing environment. Our biometric wellness tracking wristbands can even monitor how your stress levels respond to different aromatherapy combinations.

user:
That's incredible! I have some allergies though - is that a concern?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest has allergies and is concerned about aromatherapy safety. The system mentions allergy-friendly environment with fragrance-free options available, so I can address their concerns and offer alternatives.

assistant channel=final:
Not at all! We're very allergy-conscious and offer fragrance-free options for guests with sensitivities. During your wellness consultation, we'll discuss any allergies or sensitivities, and our therapists can create hypoallergenic blends or use fragrance-free treatments. Our air purification system with HEPA filters helps remove allergens, and we use only premium organic oils that are less likely to cause reactions. We can also adjust our aromatherapy diffusion system or provide alternative therapeutic approaches that don't involve essential oils.

user:
Perfect! I'd love to try the aromatherapy massage. What should I expect during the session?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to know what to expect during an aromatherapy massage session. I can explain the process including the consultation, treatment experience, and post-treatment relaxation based on the system prompt information.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful choice! You'll arrive 10 minutes early for a wellness consultation where we'll discuss your preferences and any allergies. Our therapist will create a custom aromatherapy blend just for you using oils from our rooftop garden. The session takes place on our heated marble treatment table with memory foam padding, surrounded by Himalayan salt crystal lamps. You'll experience the therapeutic scents through our diffusion system while enjoying our chromotherapy lighting and music therapy. After your 60 or 90-minute session, you'll have access to our post-treatment relaxation lounge with herbal teas and fresh fruit. It's a truly immersive therapeutic experience!
