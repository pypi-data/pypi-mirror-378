Hi! We're celebrating our anniversary and wondering about couples massage options.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about couples massage services for their anniversary. I should check both the couples suite availability and get details about romantic packages to provide comprehensive information.

tool.get_romantic_package_details channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"packages":["Romantic Bliss","Anniversary Special","Moonlight Couples"],"includes":["dual treatment tables","champagne service","rose petal decorations","couples relaxation lounge"],"duration":"90 minutes","price_range":"$280-350 per couple"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Great! Now I have the romantic package details. I should ask about their preferred date and time to check availability for the couples suite.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations on your anniversary! We have wonderful couples massage options in our private couples suite. We offer three romantic packages: Romantic Bliss, Anniversary Special, and Moonlight Couples, all featuring dual treatment tables, champagne service, and rose petal decorations. What date were you thinking for your celebration?

user:
This Saturday evening would be perfect.

assistant channel=analysis:
They want Saturday evening. I need to check availability for the couples suite on that date and time slot.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.check_couples_suite_availability:
{"date": "2024-01-20", "time_slot": "evening"}

tool.check_couples_suite_availability channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"available": true, "time_slots": ["18:00", "19:30"], "recommended": "19:30 for romantic ambiance", "special_note": "Moonlight package available for evening slots"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Perfect! They have availability for Saturday evening. I should recommend the 19:30 slot with the Moonlight package since it's specifically designed for evening romantic experiences.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice! We have availability this Saturday evening at 6:00 PM or 7:30 PM. I'd recommend the 7:30 PM slot with our Moonlight Couples package - it's specifically designed for evening romantic experiences and includes our signature chromotherapy lighting with romantic color programs. The package includes 90 minutes of side-by-side massage, champagne service, and access to our couples relaxation lounge afterward.

user:
That sounds absolutely perfect! What should we expect during the session?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to know what to expect during the couples massage session. I can provide details from the system prompt about the experience, amenities, and process.

assistant channel=final:
You'll arrive 10 minutes early for a wellness consultation where our therapists will discuss your preferences and any areas of focus. The couples suite features dual heated marble treatment tables with memory foam padding, and you'll enjoy our custom aromatherapy blends from our rooftop herb garden. The room includes Himalayan salt crystal lamps, soundproof acoustic panels, and our chromotherapy LED system with romantic lighting programs. After your 90-minute session, you'll have access to our post-treatment relaxation lounge with herbal teas and fresh fruit.

user:
Do you have any special anniversary add-ons?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about special anniversary add-ons. This information isn't specifically covered in my system prompt or tools, so I should use the [ATTENTION] flag to indicate I need to search for more information about additional anniversary services.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about anniversary add-ons. Checking available options.

user:
That's okay, the Moonlight package sounds wonderful as is.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is satisfied with the Moonlight package and doesn't need additional information about add-ons. This is a simple acknowledgment response.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful! The Moonlight Couples package will create a truly memorable anniversary experience. Would you like me to book the 7:30 PM slot for this Saturday? I can also arrange for any dietary preferences for the champagne service.
