This is perfect! Can I book a session for tomorrow? I want to be fresh for my race on Saturday.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to book for tomorrow to prepare for Saturday's race. I should provide booking information and remind them about the early arrival requirement for consultation, plus mention the timing for race preparation.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! Tomorrow is perfect timing for your Saturday race. We're open 11:00–21:00 daily, with the last 60-minute session starting at 20:00. I'd recommend arriving 10 minutes early for your wellness consultation so our therapist can assess your hamstrings and calves and create a targeted treatment plan. For race preparation, I'd suggest a 90-minute session to ensure thorough treatment of your tight muscles. This timing will give you a full day of recovery before your race. What time works best for you tomorrow?
