I'm really interested in the technology you use here. Can you tell me about the wellness tech features?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about wellness technology features. I can provide detailed information from the system prompt about our chromotherapy, music therapy, biometric tracking, and other tech features.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We're proud of our cutting-edge wellness technology. Our chromotherapy LED lighting system offers 12 different color therapy programs designed to enhance relaxation and healing. We have integrated music therapy featuring binaural beats and nature sounds that synchronize with your brainwaves. Our smart temperature control maintains the optimal 22°C (72°F) with 45% humidity for maximum comfort. We also offer biometric wellness tracking wristbands that monitor your stress levels throughout your treatment.

user:
That's fascinating! How does the biometric tracking work?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to know more about the biometric tracking wristbands. I should explain how they work and offer to check availability for a demo or to use them during a treatment.

{"available": true, "quantity": 8, "features": ["heart_rate_monitoring", "stress_level_tracking", "sleep_quality_analysis", "real_time_feedback"], "demo_available": true}

assistant channel=analysis:
Great! The wristbands are available and I can offer a demo. I should explain how the biometric tracking works and offer to schedule a demonstration.

assistant channel=final:
The biometric wristbands monitor your heart rate, track stress levels, analyze sleep quality, and provide real-time feedback during your treatment. They use advanced sensors to measure your physiological responses and help our therapists customize your massage experience. We have 8 wristbands available today, and I can arrange a demonstration if you'd like to see how they work.

user:
Yes, I'd love a demo! What does the chromotherapy system look like?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants a demo and is asking about the chromotherapy system. I should schedule a demo and explain the chromotherapy features from the system prompt.

assistant channel=analysis:
Perfect! The demo is scheduled. Now I should explain the chromotherapy system details from the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent! I've scheduled a 30-minute full technology tour for you at 3:00 PM with Sarah Chen, our Wellness Technology Specialist. The chromotherapy system features LED panels that can display 12 different color therapy programs - from calming blues and greens for relaxation to energizing oranges and reds for revitalization. Each color is scientifically calibrated to affect your mood and energy levels. The system can create dynamic light shows that gradually transition between colors or maintain a steady therapeutic hue throughout your treatment.

user:
This sounds amazing! I'm really impressed with how advanced this spa is.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is expressing appreciation for the spa's technology. This is a positive response that I should acknowledge warmly.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! We believe that combining traditional massage therapy with cutting-edge wellness technology creates the most effective and personalized experience. Our goal is to help you achieve optimal relaxation and wellness through both human touch and innovative technology. The demo will give you a hands-on experience with all these features.

user:
Can I also book a massage after the demo?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to book a massage after the demo. I should check availability and offer to schedule a treatment that incorporates the technology they'll learn about.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! That's a perfect way to experience everything you'll learn about in the demo. We have availability for 60 or 90-minute sessions after 4:00 PM. I'd recommend a 90-minute session so you can fully experience the chromotherapy lighting, music therapy, and biometric tracking during your treatment. Would you prefer Swedish, Deep Tissue, or Aromatherapy massage?
