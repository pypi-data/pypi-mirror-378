Hi—2006. Can I get a razor now and another tomorrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
Limit is two per room per day, resets daily. I’ll send one now and confirm policy.

Sent. You can request up to two today and the count resets tomorrow. We’re 24/7 if you need anything.

Nice—thanks. Busy night up there?

Steady, but fully staffed. Happy to help anytime.

[ATTENTION] Could you bring a lint roller too?

That item isn’t in my system. I can provide the listed complimentary kits only.
