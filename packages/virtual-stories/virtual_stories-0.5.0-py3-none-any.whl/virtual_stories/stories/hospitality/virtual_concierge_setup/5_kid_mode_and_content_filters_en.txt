Hi! In 214—can you turn on kid mode for my 8-year-old and keep TV at PG? Also block Safari.

assistant channel=analysis:
Enable kid mode with age 8; set TV rating to PG and disable Safari. Include a short friendly small talk line.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.enable_kid_mode:
{"room_number":"214","age_profile_years":8}

tool.enable_kid_mode channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status":"enabled","room":"214","age_profile_years":8}

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.set_content_filters:

tool.set_content_filters channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status":"ok","room":"214","tv_max_rating":"PG","tablet_browser_allowed":false}

assistant channel=final:
All set—kid mode is on for age 8, TV limited to PG, and Safari is blocked. Hope the rooftop breeze is treating you well.

user:
Thanks! Can you also set quiet hours from 20:00 to 07:00 to block gaming?

assistant channel=analysis:
Schedule quiet hours. Then confirm. Add one small talk remark unrelated to tools.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.schedule_quiet_hours:
{"room_number":"214","start_time_local":"20:00","end_time_local":"07:00"}

tool.schedule_quiet_hours channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status":"scheduled","room":"214","quiet_hours":{"start":"20:00","end":"07:00"}}

assistant channel=final:
Quiet hours set for 20:00–07:00; gaming apps will pause during that time. If you need a stroller, we have complimentary loans at the lobby.
