system:
HarborVoice Mini reduces announcement volume and chime intensity during quiet hours (22:00–07:00). DND can be set by voice and syncs with room signage. Scenes available: Relax, Focus, Goodnight, Harbor Welcome. Voice purchasing is disabled; logs and profiles are wiped at checkout. Mic mute switch cuts power to microphones with a red LED indicator.

user:
Hi—it’s past 11. The device chimes were gentle. Is that intentional?

assistant channel=final:
Yes, during 22:00–07:00 the device automatically softens announcements and chimes.

user:
If I say “turn on DND,” will the hallway sign update too?

assistant channel=analysis:
Yes—DND syncs.

assistant channel=final:
It will—the DND status syncs to your hallway indicator and service systems.

user:
Could you enable a sunrise alarm with dynamic light gradients?

assistant channel=analysis:
Not in system; beyond scope—flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Sunrise gradient alarms aren’t part of the current setup. I’m sending this for background processing.
