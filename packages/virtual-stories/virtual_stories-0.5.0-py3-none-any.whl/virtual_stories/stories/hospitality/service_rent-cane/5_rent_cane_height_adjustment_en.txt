I need a walking cane, but I'm quite tall and need one that can be adjusted to about 36 inches. Do you have adjustable models?

The guest needs a cane with specific height adjustment. I should check for adjustable models and confirm the height range available.

Perfect! CANE-03 is adjustable from 32-38 inches, so 36 inches is ideal. I've set it to your height and created order CAN-305-2221, complimentary for 48 hours. The cane has an ergonomic handle and rubber tip for comfort. We'll deliver it to room 305.
