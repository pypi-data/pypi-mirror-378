Absolutely! I'll set up a sports-appropriate shower configuration for your teen athlete. I'll configure the temperature to 102째F for optimal post-workout recovery, set the handheld shower pressure to medium for teen athletes, and arrange sports recovery amenities. What's your room number and what sports activities is your son participating in?

Room 1427. He's in the basketball tournament and will be doing multiple games per day, so he'll need good recovery options.
