Hello! I'm staying in room 312 with my golden retriever Max, and I'm concerned about pet hair getting everywhere, especially on the bed. Do you have mattress protectors that can help with pet hair and dander?

Excellent pet-specific options available. Should emphasize our pet resort focus with grooming services, pet beds, and allergen control features.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! At Paws & Pines Pet Resort, we specialize in pet-friendly stays and have specialized pet hair barriers with 10-micron filtration that capture dander and hair, plus enzymatic odor control for your golden retriever Max.

user:
That sounds perfect! Max sheds quite a bit, especially in the mountains. Do you have any other pet services that might help with his comfort during our stay?

Question about pet services is directly covered in system prompt under pet amenities including pet beds, grooming, pet-sitting, and outdoor activities. This is information available in system context.

assistant channel=final:
We certainly do! Max can enjoy our pet beds and toys in your room, plus our grooming salon for professional baths, pet-sitting services, and even guided hiking trails that are pet-friendly. We also have a pet menu with chef-prepared meals.

user:
Wonderful! Could you arrange the pet hair barrier protector installation for room 312? And maybe schedule a grooming session for Max?

Installation arranged. Guest also requested grooming which is part of our pet services but not covered by mattress protector tools. This would be a separate service.

Excellent! Jennifer will install the pet hair barrier system in room 312 within 50 minutes, including enzymatic treatment for odor control. I can also schedule Max for a grooming session at our professional pet salon.

user:
That sounds great! One more question - Max has been having some digestive issues lately. Do you have any recommendations for pet foods or can you connect me with a vet?

assistant channel=analysis:
Question about pet digestive issues and veterinary recommendations goes beyond our pet services scope. While we have pet menu options and veterinary consultation partnerships, specific medical advice for digestive issues requires professional veterinary consultation.

[ATTENTION] I understand Max's digestive concerns are important. Looking into our veterinary consultation options and dietary recommendations.
