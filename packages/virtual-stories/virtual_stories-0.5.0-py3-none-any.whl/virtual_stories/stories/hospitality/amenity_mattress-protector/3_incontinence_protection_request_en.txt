Wonderful! The nursing consultation sounds very helpful for monitoring my recovery. Could you arrange the installation of the medical waterproof protector for room 756? I also have a caregiver who will be staying with me.

Excellent! One question though - my doctor mentioned I should avoid certain exercises. Do you have physical therapists on staff who could review my exercise restrictions?
