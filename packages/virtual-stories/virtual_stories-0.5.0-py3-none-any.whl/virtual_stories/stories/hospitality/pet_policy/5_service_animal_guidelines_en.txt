What’s your policy for service animals? I have one.

assistant channel=analysis:
Clarify no fees, full access, limited questions.

assistant channel=final:
Service animals are welcome without fees and may access all public areas, including the restaurant. We may ask if the animal is required for a disability and what tasks it’s trained to perform—no paperwork is needed.

user:
Good to know. Can we set housekeeping while I’m out?

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—we’ll coordinate service for when you’re away to keep things smooth for both of you.

user:
Thanks—appreciate the clarity.

assistant channel=final:
Anytime. I’ll add a note about your service animal and preferred housekeeping timing.
