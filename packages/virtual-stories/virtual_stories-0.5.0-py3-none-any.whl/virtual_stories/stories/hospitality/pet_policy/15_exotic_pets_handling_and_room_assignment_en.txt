user:
Hi! Your sunroom lobby lives up to the name. I have a small gecko—can we make it work?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; exotic pet review; enclosure requirement; ground-floor tile room.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks! We can consider exotic pets case by case. If your gecko stays in a secure enclosure and out of public areas, I can assign a ground-floor tile room away from the elevator and schedule a post-stay deep clean.

user:
Is there any special fee?

assistant channel=analysis:
No explicit fee defined—policy mentions case-by-case; avoid inventing fees; acknowledge review.

assistant channel=final:
There isn’t a set exotic-pet fee; I’ll note it for case-by-case review and confirm if any charges would apply before arrival.

user:
Could you arrange a temporary wildlife permit for display at a local fair?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Understood on the permit request. Investigating requirements.
