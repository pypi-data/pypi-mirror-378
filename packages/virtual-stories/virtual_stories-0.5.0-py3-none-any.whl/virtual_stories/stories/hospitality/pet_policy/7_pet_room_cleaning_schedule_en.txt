Could housekeeping come right after our morning walk?

Offer 11:00–12:00 block; confirm pet out of room.

We can schedule the 11:00–12:00 block so you can do the walk and we’ll service while your pet is out. Does that timing work?

Yes, that’s perfect. Thanks for being flexible.

Small talk.

Happy to—our goal is a smooth stay. I’ve noted your preferred window.
