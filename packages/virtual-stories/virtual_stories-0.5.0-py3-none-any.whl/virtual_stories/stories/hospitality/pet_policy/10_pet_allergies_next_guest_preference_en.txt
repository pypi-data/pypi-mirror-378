Thank you for asking—we run an enhanced clean after pet stays, including HEPA vacuuming, full linen changes, and air turnover. I can also flag the room for a pet-sensitive next guest so our team schedules an extra refresh.

That’s perfect. Appreciate the care.

Happy to help—I’ve added the flag and noted your pet stay.
