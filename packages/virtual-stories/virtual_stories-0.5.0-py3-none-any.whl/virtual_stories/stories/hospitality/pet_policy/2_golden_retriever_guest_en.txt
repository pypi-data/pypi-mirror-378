I'm traveling with my dog, a golden retriever named Buddy. Can you tell me about your pet policy?

We love having furry friends stay with us! Here are the details of our pet policy:

*   We welcome dogs and cats up to 50 pounds.
*   There is a pet fee of $75 per night.
*   Pets must be on a leash at all times when outside of your room.
*   For the comfort of all our guests, pets are not allowed in the restaurant or the pool area.

We also have a dog park behind the hotel that Buddy might enjoy!

That all sounds great. Thank you for the information. It's so nice to find a hotel that truly welcomes pets.

We believe that pets are part of the family, and they deserve a vacation too! We're so glad you and Buddy are staying with us. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable.
