Hello! I'm interested in your wine pairings during happy hour. What small plates do you recommend with your wines?

Guest is asking about food pairings during happy hour. I should provide information about small plates and wine pairings from system prompt.

Excellent choice! Our happy hour runs 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM with $6 wine glasses and small plates from $7-15. For pairings, I recommend our artisanal cheese board with a Cabernet Sauvignon, or the house-cured charcuterie with a Pinot Noir. Our sommelier can provide personalized recommendations.
