user:
Great! Do you have any recommendations for food and drinks that work well for business networking?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for recommendations for food and drinks suitable for business networking. I can provide recommendations based on the happy hour menu and the professional context.

assistant channel=final:
For business networking, I'd recommend our artisanal small plates that are easy to eat while networking: $11 Caprese Skewers and $13 Quinoa Salad are perfect finger foods. For drinks, our $10 Pinot Grigio and $8 Aperol Spritz are elegant choices that won't be too strong for professional conversations. The $12 Craft Gin Tonic is also popular for business events - sophisticated but approachable.

user:
What about the live entertainment? Will that interfere with our business meeting?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about live entertainment interfering with their business meeting. From the system prompt, I can see that acoustic performances are on Wednesdays and Fridays 18:00-19:00, so Thursday wouldn't have live music.

assistant channel=final:
No interference at all! Live acoustic performances are scheduled for Wednesdays and Fridays from 18:00-19:00, so your Thursday meeting will have a quiet, professional atmosphere. We maintain a sophisticated ambiance perfect for business discussions, with just our curated background music.

Yes! We offer corporate packages with custom pricing for regular business clients. These can include preferred rates for recurring meetings, dedicated account management, and flexible booking arrangements. The packages are tailored to your specific business needs and can include extended meeting times beyond regular happy hour.
