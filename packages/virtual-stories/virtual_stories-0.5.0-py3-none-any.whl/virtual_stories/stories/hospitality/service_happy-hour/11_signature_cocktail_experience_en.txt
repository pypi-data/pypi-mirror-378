Hi! I'm really interested in trying your signature cocktails during happy hour. What do you recommend?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about signature cocktails during happy hour. I should provide information about our signature drinks and bartender recommendations from system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful choice! Our happy hour runs from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM with $6 signature cocktails. We have 25+ unique creations by our master mixologist. I recommend the "Miami Sunset" with rum, passionfruit, and a secret spice blend, or the "Skyline Martini" featuring local citrus and premium vodka.

user:
Those sound amazing! Can you tell me more about the Miami Sunset?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking for details about a specific signature cocktail which is mentioned in the system prompt as one of our house creations.

assistant channel=final:
The Miami Sunset is our most popular signature cocktail! It combines premium Caribbean rum with fresh passionfruit juice, lime, and our secret blend of tropical spices, finished with a edible flower garnish. During happy hour it's just $6, compared to $14 at regular price.

user:
Perfect! And what about non-alcoholic options?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about non-alcoholic options which are mentioned in the system prompt as mocktails and fresh juices.

assistant channel=final:
We have excellent non-alcoholic options too! Our "Virgin Sunset" is a non-alcoholic version of our signature with the same fresh ingredients and spice blend for $5 during happy hour. We also offer fresh-squeezed juices, mocktails, and sparkling beverages.

user:
Great! Do you have any special packages for groups?

assistant channel=analysis:

Yes, we offer custom drink menus for groups of 8 or more! You can create your own signature cocktail experience with personalized drinks at happy hour pricing. We can also arrange private seating areas and special entertainment for your group.
