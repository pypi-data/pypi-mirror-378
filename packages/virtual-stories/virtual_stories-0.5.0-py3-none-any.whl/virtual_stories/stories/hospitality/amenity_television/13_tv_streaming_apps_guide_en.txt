Your TV comes with several pre-installed streaming apps including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, and Spotify. You also have access to additional services like Hulu, Apple TV+, Paramount+, Peacock, and Discovery+ through the Samsung Smart Hub. For sports, you can access ESPN+ and various premium sports networks. The TV runs on Samsung Tizen OS with voice control, so you can simply say "Open Netflix" to launch apps hands-free.

That's great! How do I sign into my personal accounts on these apps?

You can sign into your personal accounts on any of the streaming apps using your regular login credentials. The TV operates in Guest Mode, which means all your personal information and login details are automatically cleared when you check out for complete privacy. You can also use the voice control feature to search for specific shows or movies across all your connected services.

The coffee from the lobby cart this morning was absolutely perfect.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about the hotel's coffee service, which relates to the lobby espresso cart mentioned in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
I'm so glad you enjoyed it! Our lobby espresso cart serves single-origin roasts from 6–11AM daily. The baristas are trained in specialty coffee preparation, and we rotate our bean selections seasonally to offer unique flavors.

Can you install custom apps or modify the TV's operating system to add new streaming services that aren't available in the app store?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about installing custom apps or modifying the operating system, which goes beyond what's available in the system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since no tools or system knowledge covers custom app installation or OS modifications.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand your request. Checking available options.
