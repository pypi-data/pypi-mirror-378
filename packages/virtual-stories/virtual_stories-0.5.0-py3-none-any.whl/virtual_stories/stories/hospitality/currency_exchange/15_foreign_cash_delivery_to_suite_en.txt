Hi! I’m lounging by the lagoon—mocktails later sound perfect. Could you deliver ¥150,000 JPY to my suite tomorrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
JPY supported; pre‑order by 14:00 for next‑day 10:00–14:00. Verify delivery fee and limits.

Absolutely. If we place the order by 14:00 today, we can deliver ¥150,000 JPY to your suite between 10:00–14:00 tomorrow. The delivery fee is $12, waived if your total reaches $2,000 equivalent. We’ll verify your passport and room key upon delivery and provide an itemized receipt.

user:
Can you lock today’s rate right now and bring it at 18:00 instead?

assistant channel=analysis:
Rate locks at fulfillment; delivery window is 10:00–14:00 next day. Cannot promise different; state policy.

assistant channel=final:
Our rate locks at fulfillment time, and in‑suite deliveries run 10:00–14:00 the next day for orders placed by 14:00. We can proceed under that window.

user:
Could you also arrange a same‑day airport currency pickup desk to coordinate with my flight gate?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system scope. Use special flag.
