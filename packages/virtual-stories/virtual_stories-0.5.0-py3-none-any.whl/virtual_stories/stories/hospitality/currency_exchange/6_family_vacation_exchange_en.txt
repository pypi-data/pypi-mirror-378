The Great Barrier Reef is absolutely breathtaking - I've seen photos and it looks like something from another world! England is indeed charming with its rich history. I've been here at Royal Caribbean Resort for 7 years now. It's the perfect place to work because every day I get to hear about amazing adventures like yours. What made you choose Miami for the end of your trip?

If you want to explore, South Beach is only a 20-minute drive and has incredible people-watching. We also offer sunset catamaran cruises that the whole family enjoys! Would you like me to arrange a cruise for tomorrow evening?
