user:
Hi, I'm a very light sleeper. Could you place me in the quietest possible room tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm attributes: away from elevator/ice/vending, west-facing, higher floor, Executive King if available; reassure and add small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely. For the quietest setup here at Riverside Quay, we aim for west-facing Executive King on floors 18–24, rooms x21–x28, away from elevators, ice (x08), and vending (x19). May I place you on a high west-facing floor and schedule housekeeping after 15:00 so your morning remains undisturbed?

user:
That sounds perfect. Please keep me far from the elevators—I can hear the chimes.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge elevator chime sensitivity; restate we will avoid x10–x18 stacks.

assistant channel=final:
Got it—we'll avoid the x10–x18 elevator stacks and target x21–x28. I'll also request a corridor end room to minimize foot traffic. Is a higher floor, say above 20, okay for you?

user:
Above 20 is great. Any chance the construction will be an issue at night?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use system facts: construction runs daytime only.

assistant channel=final:
No worries there—the neighboring construction operates 09:30–16:30 only, never at night. Your evenings and late night should remain quiet.

user:
Thanks. Could housekeeping skip the morning too? I sleep in.

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer housekeeping after 15:00.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we can schedule housekeeping after 15:00. I’ll note “Do Not Disturb” for the morning and an afternoon service window.

user:
Appreciate it. By the way, long day traveling.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; wish them a restful stay without introducing new facts.

assistant channel=final:
Welcome to Melbourne—travel can take it out of anyone. We’ll make sure tonight is restful so you’re refreshed tomorrow.

user:
Perfect. Anything else I should know about the room?

assistant channel=analysis:
Mention HVAC low-night mode and Quiet Hours.

assistant channel=final:
Two quick notes: Executive rooms here have a low-night HVAC fan mode to reduce airflow noise, and our Quiet Hours run 22:00–07:00 with active monitoring. If anything disturbs you, call the desk and we’ll intervene promptly.

user:
Thank you.

assistant channel=final:
My pleasure. I’ve arranged a west-facing Executive King above floor 20 in the x21–x28 stack, away from elevators and machines, with afternoon housekeeping.
