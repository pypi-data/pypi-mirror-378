Hotel: Lakeside Wellness Hotel, 220 North Shore Road, Minneapolis, MN.
Facts:
- Elevators cluster mid-corridor; acoustic buffer rooms x17–x19 (utility walls) reduce chime bleed.
- Best compromise: floors 8–12, north lakeside, rooms x18 or x19.
- Spa closes 21:00; Quiet Hours 21:30–07:00.
- Ice/vending at x07; avoid adjacency for quiet.

user:
I can’t be far from the elevators, but I really need it quiet.

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer x18/x19 with buffer; confirm north side.

assistant channel=final:
We have buffered rooms x18 and x19 near the elevators where utility walls absorb most chime noise. Would a north-facing room toward the lake on floors 8–12 work?

user:
Yes, please—and not near the ice machine.

assistant channel=analysis:
Affirm avoid x07.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—we’ll avoid the x07 stack near ice and place you in x18 or x19. Quiet Hours begin at 21:30 so nights stay peaceful.

user:
Thanks. Travel was tiring today.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Understood—let’s make the rest easy. I’ll finalize a north-facing x18 on floor 10, close but calm.
