Excellent timing choice! 10 AM-1 PM avoids the afternoon heat perfectly. We'll set up desert treasure hunts and fun relay races - very popular with 7-year-olds! Plus our shade structures and misters will keep everyone comfortable. Would you like our catering partnership or bringing your own food?

The desert is truly stunning! We actually incorporate desert themes into our treasure hunts - kids love discovering "gems" among the cacti in our garden photo areas.
