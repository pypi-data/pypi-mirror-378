system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. On-site prints are standard photo stock up to 8x10; not certified archival. Typical turnaround 15–30 minutes for small jobs during 08:00–20:00 staffed hours.

user:
I’d love to print a gift photo that lasts—do your prints count as archival?

assistant channel=analysis:
Clarify non-archival status; offer best on-site option and proof.

assistant channel=final:
Our on-site prints look great for gifting but aren’t certified archival. We can still produce a high-quality 8x10 on photo stock today and do a quick proof so you can check tones before we run the final.

user:
Could you guarantee a 100-year fade resistance if framed?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guarantee specifics beyond system context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about longevity. Verifying information.
