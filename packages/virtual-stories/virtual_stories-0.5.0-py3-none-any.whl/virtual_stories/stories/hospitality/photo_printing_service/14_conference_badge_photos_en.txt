Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Business Center can print standardized photo sizes commonly used for IDs (e.g., 2x2 inch equivalents on photo stock) by cropping images provided by guests; background changes not performed on site.

user:
I need 2x2 inch ID photos with a plain background—can you do that?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm sizing via cropping; clarify no background edits; small talk.

assistant channel=final:
We can crop your images to a 2x2 inch equivalent on photo stock and print them cleanly. We don’t alter backgrounds on site, but if your originals are simple, they typically read well for badges. Want to email the files so we can prep a proof?

user:
Can you remove the shadows from my photo?

assistant channel=analysis:
Background/shadow edits beyond context; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about cleanup. Checking available options.
