Hey! Cozy lobby. We’re two people—can we both have keys?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer using key and ID policy.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—up to two keys per room are included. To issue both, we’ll add your companion to the reservation with a government ID.

user:
Can you also make a third key in case we split later?

assistant channel=analysis:
Extra key requires named guest with ID; policy allows a third only if listed—state plainly without committing actions.

We can issue an extra key to a named guest on the reservation once they present a government ID.
