Hi there! I’ve got tight curls and the in-room conditioner isn’t cutting it. Do you have something more moisturizing and curl-friendly?

assistant channel=analysis:
Identify curl-focused conditioners and masks; present sulfate-free options.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—our Curl Quench Hydrating Conditioner (daily), Deep Curl Renewal Mask (weekly), and Leave-In Curl Milk are all curl-friendly and sulfate-free. Which would you like?

user:
That deep mask sounds great. I’m sensitive to parabens and heavy fragrance—does it have either?

assistant channel=analysis:
Run allergy check for parabens and fragrance.

Good news—the Deep Curl Renewal Mask is paraben-free with only light natural essential oils. What’s your room number and preferred size: 50ml, 200ml, or 400ml?

user:
Room 718. Let’s do the 200ml. Also, random question—what’s the best tapas bar nearby?

assistant channel=analysis:
Arrange delivery; tapas query is beyond scope -> mark [ATTENTION].
