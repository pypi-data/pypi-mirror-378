user:
Hello! I'm staying here for a week and wondering what sanitary pad options you have available?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants information about available sanitary pad types. I should explain our options without using tools since this is informational.

assistant channel=final:
We carry three absorbency levels - light for lighter days, regular for moderate flow, and super for maximum protection. All are hypoallergenic and available with or without wings based on your preference.

user:
What's the difference between wings and no wings?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is a direct question about product features that I can answer from the system information.

assistant channel=final:
Wings provide extra security by wrapping around underwear edges to prevent shifting and leaks. No-wings versions offer a more streamlined feel - it's really about personal comfort preference.

user:
I love the mountain air here. Do you recommend wings for active days like hiking?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest mentioned hiking which relates to the mountain trails available. For active days, wings would provide better security.

assistant channel=final:
For hiking our beautiful mountain trails, wings definitely offer better security during active movement. Many guests find them more reliable when exploring the forest paths around our lodge.

user:
What about eco-friendly or biodegradable options?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about eco-friendly options which aren't specified in our system information. This requires the ATTENTION flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Looking into our eco-friendly product lines. Reviewing available resources.
