Fascinating! Do you offer any specialized foraging experiences where guests can actually harvest ingredients that go into their tea service?

The guest is asking about foraging experiences where they could harvest ingredients for their own tea service. This is a very specific experiential offering that would involve guided foraging activities, which goes beyond my standard seasonal menu knowledge.
