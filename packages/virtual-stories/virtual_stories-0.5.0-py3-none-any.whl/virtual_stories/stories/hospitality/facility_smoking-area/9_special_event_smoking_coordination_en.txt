Hi, I'm planning a wedding reception for 150 guests next Saturday and about 30-40 of them will want to smoke during the evening. Can you help coordinate something special for them?

assistant channel=analysis:
Wedding planner needs smoking area coordination for significant number of guests. Should coordinate event logistics and suggest appropriate package.

Absolutely! For 30-40 smokers, I recommend our Premium Wedding Package using both Ocean Terrace and Garden Pavilion. Includes elegant furniture, floral arrangements matching your theme, dedicated staff, ambient lighting, and cocktail service. We'll coordinate timing with your ceremony and dining schedule. What's your wedding theme or color scheme?

user:
The theme is coastal elegance with navy blue and white. That sounds perfect! Can we also have some kind of premium cigars available? The groom's father is a cigar enthusiast.

assistant channel=analysis:
Specific theme colors provided, and request for premium cigars for VIP guest (groom's father). Should accommodate both requests.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! We'll coordinate navy and white floral arrangements with coastal accents. For the groom's father, we can arrange a premium cigar selection including Arturo Fuente, Montecristo, and Romeo y Julieta in a dedicated humidor station. We'll also provide professional cigar cutting and lighting service.

user:
That's wonderful. One concern—will the smoking areas be visible in wedding photos? We're doing sunset photos around 7 PM on the terrace.

assistant channel=analysis:
Valid concern about photo aesthetics during wedding photography. Should address visual coordination and timing.

assistant channel=final:
Great question! Our Ocean Terrace offers stunning sunset backdrops, and we'll position the smoking amenities to complement photos, not distract. We can temporarily relocate smoking furniture during formal photo sessions (7-7:30 PM) then reset. Many couples actually include atmospheric smoking area shots—very elegant with our setup.

user:
Perfect planning! This is exactly what we needed. How far in advance should I confirm final guest count?

assistant channel=analysis:
Practical question about final arrangements timing.

assistant channel=final:
We'll hold the Premium Package for Saturday. Final headcount by Wednesday gives us time to adjust seating and cigar quantities. I'll send you a detailed coordination timeline this afternoon. Your smoking guests will have an elegant, comfortable experience!

user:
You've thought of everything. This is going to be such a special day!

Guest expressing excitement and satisfaction with the wedding planning coordination.

assistant channel=final:
It's our pleasure to make your special day perfect! Coastal elegance with premium smoking amenities—your guests will remember this celebration. Congratulations, and we can't wait to host your beautiful wedding!
