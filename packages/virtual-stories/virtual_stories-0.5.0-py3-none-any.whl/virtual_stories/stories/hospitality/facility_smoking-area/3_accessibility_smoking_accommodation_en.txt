Hi there. I use a wheelchair and I'm wondering about your smoking areas. Are they accessible? I had trouble at my last hotel.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! All our smoking areas are fully ADA-compliant with ramps, wider pathways, and adjustable-height ash stations. We have three locations: Poolside Pavilion (ground level), Garden Terrace (ramped), and Beachside Gazebo (boardwalk access). Each has emergency call buttons and companion seating.

user:
That's a relief! The beachside one sounds nice. How do I get there from the lobby?

assistant channel=analysis:
Simple directional question about getting to beachside location. Based on system info, it has boardwalk access.

assistant channel=final:
From the lobby, take the main elevator to ground floor, exit through the rear doors to the pool deck, then follow the accessible boardwalk path to the right. It's about 200 feet with smooth surfaces all the way. Clear signage marks the route.

user:
Perfect. One thing - I sometimes need help with the door handles on windy days. Is there assistance available?

assistant channel=analysis:
