I'm visiting next week and I heard Denver gets pretty cold in September. Do your smoking areas have any kind of weather protection?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest asking about weather protection for smoking areas. It's September, so some winter features might be available. Should mention both current and upcoming seasonal preparations.

assistant channel=final:
Great question! September in Denver can be unpredictable. Our Mountain View Pavilion has heated shelter with glass panels, and the Courtyard Gazebo has overhead heating. We start winter prep in October with full heating systems, but blankets and hot beverage service are available year-round if it gets chilly.

user:
That's perfect. I'm actually from Minnesota so I'm used to cold, but I appreciate having options. What about if it rains?

assistant channel=analysis:
Follow-up about rain protection. System mentions retractable canopies and covered areas.

assistant channel=final:
All our areas have retractable canopies for rain protection. The Mountain View Pavilion is fully covered, and we can extend canopies over the Courtyard Gazebo within minutes. Plus, walkways have covered connections so you won't get soaked getting there.

user:
Nice! I like the mountain views too. Speaking of Minnesota, do you get many guests from the Midwest?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk about guest demographics, moving away from smoking areas to casual conversation.

assistant channel=final:
Quite a few! Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois—lots of folks escaping to our mile-high altitude. The mountain views really seem to hit differently for people from flatter states. You'll love the sunrise over the Rockies from that pavilion.

user:
I can't wait. This trip is exactly what I need after a long work season.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest sharing personal context about needing relaxation, supportive response appropriate.

assistant channel=final:
Denver's perfect for unwinding. The fresh mountain air and those views from our smoking areas are pretty therapeutic. Enjoy your well-deserved break!

user:
Thanks! One last thing - do I need to reserve the pavilion or is it first-come-first-served?

assistant channel=analysis:
Practical question about reservations. Not mentioned in system prompt, but for individual use vs group reservations discussed earlier, likely first-come-first-served for individuals.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Let me check the current reservation policy for individual guests. Reviewing available options.
