The Grand Heritage Manor was originally built in 1872 as a grand hotel for Victorian-era travelers. Our traditional amenities, including this hand soap, were part of the original hotel's luxury offerings. The beeswax formula was considered a luxury item in the Victorian era, reflecting the period's emphasis on hygiene and herbal medicine.
