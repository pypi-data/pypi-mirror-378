That's very thoughtful! Actually, I'm presenting at the downtown convention center. Any tips on getting there quickly? I'm not familiar with the morning traffic patterns here.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about traffic patterns and transportation to convention center - this is beyond our standard hotel information. We don't have real-time traffic data or detailed local transportation expertise.

[ATTENTION] The convention center is just a 10-minute walk or 5-minute cab ride from here, but morning traffic can vary. Checking available options.
