Perfect timing! We'll have everything ready by 8 PM. Our rooftop bar is amazing with live music most nights and great views of the city. Tonight features a local indie rock band that your group might enjoy. We can even reserve a table if you'd like.

I've reserved a great rooftop table for your group at 9 PM. There's no cover charge for hotel guests - just show your key cards at the door. The music starts around 8:30 PM, so you'll have time to freshen up after your adventures. Would you like me to arrange any pre-show appetizers or drinks?

Our escape rooms are fantastic team-building experiences! We have themed rooms that take 45-60 minutes and are perfect for groups of 6. They're available from 10 AM to 10 PM, and we can customize difficulty levels. Each room has different themes like "haunted mansion" or "spy mission" with puzzles, clues, and immersive storytelling.

We're into mystery themes - which one would you recommend for our group?

assistant channel=final:
For mystery themes, I'd recommend our "Detective's Den" room - it has intricate puzzles, hidden compartments, and a great storyline about solving a century-old mystery. It's challenging but not overwhelming, and your group size is perfect for it. We also have the "Time Traveler's Dilemma" if you want something more sci-fi mystery.

user:
Do you have any recommendations for the best BBQ spots in town? We're all huge BBQ fans.
