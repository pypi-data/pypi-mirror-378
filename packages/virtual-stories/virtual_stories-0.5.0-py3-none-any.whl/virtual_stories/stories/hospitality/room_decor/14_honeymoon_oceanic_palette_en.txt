Hello—could you prepare the Oceanic palette in our Tide Suite this afternoon?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm palette items and timing; add warm tone.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations! We’ll coordinate the deep teal runner, sand-gold pillows, ivory linens, 36 flameless candles ($52), and the silk petals deluxe ($60). The sea breeze diffuser is included. We can install between 15:00–16:00 while you’re out. Shall we add the “Just Married” banner ($20 rental) as well?

user:
Yes, please add the banner. Are real candles allowed in the bathroom only?

assistant channel=analysis:
Policy: no real flames anywhere.

assistant channel=final:
For safety, real flames aren’t permitted anywhere in the suite. The LEDs look beautiful reflected in the bathroom mirror—great ambience without the risk.

user:
Could you arrange a last-minute violinist inside the room at 6 PM?

assistant channel=analysis:
External live music booking beyond scope; trigger flag.

[ATTENTION] What a romantic idea. Searching for more information.
