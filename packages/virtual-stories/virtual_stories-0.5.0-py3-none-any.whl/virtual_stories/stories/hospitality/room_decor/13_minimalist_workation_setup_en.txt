Hi! Can you help me set up a simple on-camera background for calls in the Pearl Suite?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer backdrop and light; add small talk.

assistant channel=final:
We can place the ivory linen backdrop behind the desk ($18) and provide a ring light with adjustable warmth. The desk has two 60W USB-C ports, so powering your laptop and light is smooth. Want the Cable Tidy Kit as well? How are calls going this week—big presentations?

user:
Yes, add the Cable Tidy Kit. Can housekeeping skip the desk tomorrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm housekeeping can avoid desk if requested.

assistant channel=final:
Done—we’ll add a note for 14:30–16:00 housekeeping to avoid the desk area. Setup will take about 15 minutes; we can be ready by 15:00 today.

Could you install acoustic panels on the walls for better sound by tonight?
