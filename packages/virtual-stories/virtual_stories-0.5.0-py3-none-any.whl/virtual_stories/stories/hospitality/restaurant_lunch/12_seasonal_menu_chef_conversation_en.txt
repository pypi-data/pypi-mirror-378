- Menu Philosophy: Complete menu rotation every season using peak-season ingredients, local sourcing, and seasonal cooking techniques
- Current Offerings: Spring menu featuring fresh herbs, young vegetables, light proteins, and seasonal preparation methods like grilling and raw preparations
- Chef Interaction: Open kitchen design allows guest-chef conversations, cooking demonstrations, and culinary education during service
- Ingredient Focus: Highlighting seasonal peak flavors, explaining preparation techniques, and educating guests about ingredient selection
- Innovation Program: Experimental dishes, seasonal tasting menus, and creative interpretations of traditional seasonal cuisine
The restaurant connects diners directly with seasonal eating through chef expertise, ingredient education, and immersive culinary experiences that celebrate each season's unique flavors.
