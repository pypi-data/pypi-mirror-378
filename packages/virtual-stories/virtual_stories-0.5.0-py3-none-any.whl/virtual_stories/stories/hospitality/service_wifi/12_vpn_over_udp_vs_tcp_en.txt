system:
Hotel: Harborline Quayside — Business Wing (hotel_id: hq_bw_04)
SSID: Harborline_Guest
Bandwidth policy: 150 Mbps/device; burst friendly
Support hours: 06:30–23:30, ext. 7711
Notes:
- Common VPN protocols work; some UDP tunnels can be sensitive on congested bands
- If issues arise, try TCP fallback or set VPN to auto‑reconnect
- Stick to 5 GHz where possible; move away from microwaves/metal partitions
- Captive portal refresh may prompt after IP lease renewal (~22 h)

Matrix (text):
Protocol | Works | Tip
UDP      | yes   | switch to 5 GHz; enable auto‑reconnect
TCP      | yes   | resilient on noisy RF; slightly more latency

user:
Is UDP okay here or should I force TCP?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer per matrix and notes; keep neutral and factual.

assistant channel=final:
Both work. If you see instability on UDP during congestion, switch to TCP for a steadier tunnel, or stay on 5 GHz and enable auto‑reconnect.

user:
Thanks! By the way, nice view from the lounge.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk response only.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a great spot—glad you’re enjoying it.

user:
Can you open more ports for my dev server?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope here; ATTENTION.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Your port request is noted. Checking available information.
