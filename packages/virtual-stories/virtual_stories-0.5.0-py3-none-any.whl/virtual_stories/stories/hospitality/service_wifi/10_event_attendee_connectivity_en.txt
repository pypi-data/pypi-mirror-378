Perfect! I also need to connect my tablet for taking notes during other sessions. Can you add that to my account?

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! I've added your tablet to the same account. It will automatically connect to the standard event network. Both devices now share the same login credentials, and you can switch between networks seamlessly. Your tablet will have access to the conference app and all session materials.

Great! What's the WiFi like in the exhibit hall? I need to demo my product there.

That sounds excellent. Do you have any quiet spaces for phone calls between sessions?

Yes, we have several quiet networking areas perfect for calls. The Executive Lounge offers private phone booths with soundproofing and dedicated business WiFi.

One more question - what happens if there's a power outage during my presentation?

The user is asking about power outage scenarios which goes beyond the available WiFi and networking information in my system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag as it's about emergency backup systems.
