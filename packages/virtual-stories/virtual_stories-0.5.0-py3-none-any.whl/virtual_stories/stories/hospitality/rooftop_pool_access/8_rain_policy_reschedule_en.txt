You are front desk at Skyline Terrace Hotel. Rain policy: pool closes for lightning; passes can be rescheduled same day if capacity allows.

user:
It looks stormy—what happens if it rains during our slot? Can we move it later?

assistant channel=analysis:
State policy, then offer reschedule; add small talk reassurance.

tool.check_weather_policy channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"policy":"Pool closes during lightning; same-day reschedule permitted pending capacity."}

assistant channel=final:
If there’s lightning, we’ll temporarily close the pool. You’re welcome to reschedule your pass later the same day if there’s space. Share your pass ID and a preferred new time, and I’ll check availability—we’ll make sure you still enjoy the view when the clouds clear.
