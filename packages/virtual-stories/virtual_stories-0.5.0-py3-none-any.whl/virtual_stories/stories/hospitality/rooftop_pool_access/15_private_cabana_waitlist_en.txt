system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Rooftop has shaded loungers; private cabana references relate to occasional event setups and aren’t part of standard daily access. Acrylic drinkware only; no glass on deck.

user:
Do you have private cabanas we can rent today?

assistant channel=analysis:
Clarify that standard access has shaded loungers; cabanas are event-based.

assistant channel=final:
The rooftop runs with shaded loungers for daily access. Private cabanas appear during certain events but aren’t part of the standard setup. You’ll still find comfortable shade options with the regular loungers.

user:
Could we get on a same-day waitlist if a cabana frees up?

assistant channel=analysis:
Waitlist management beyond context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Understood—digging into this question about same-day waitlist possibilities.
