Hi—does room 711 have an opener in the room, or could I borrow one?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check room status, then offer a loaner.

{"room":"711","category":"standard","opener_present":false}

assistant channel=final:
Room 711 is a standard room, so no in-room opener. I can send a cap lifter or a multitool—ETA 10–20 minutes. Which do you prefer?

user:
Just the cap lifter, please. Thanks!

Could you stock our minibar with local craft beers?
