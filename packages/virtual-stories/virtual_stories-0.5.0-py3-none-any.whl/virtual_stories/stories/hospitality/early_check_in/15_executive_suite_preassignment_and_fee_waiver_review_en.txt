Aurora Bay Hotel early check‑in structure:

- Standard check‑in 15:00. Early check‑in relies on room readiness.
- Fees: May apply before 11:00; reduced 11:00–15:00; amount varies by room type and occupancy.
- Pre‑assignment: Requests can be noted; actual readiness depends on overnight occupancy and housekeeping status.
- Priority: Elite members prioritized for first-ready rooms.

user:
Good morning—could my executive suite be pre‑assigned so I can check in at 10:00?

assistant channel=analysis:
Pre‑assignment can be noted; readiness not guaranteed.

assistant channel=final:
Good morning. I can note your pre‑assignment request; readiness at 10:00 depends on overnight occupancy and housekeeping progress. If a suite is clean before 11:00, an early check‑in fee may apply; from 11:00–15:00, the fee is typically reduced.

user:
Appreciate it. Also, thanks for the warm welcome yesterday—your team is superb.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
That’s wonderful to hear—we’ll share this with the team.

user:
Could the fee be waived for my tier level today at 10:00?

assistant channel=analysis:
Specific waiver decision not in context; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’m reviewing today’s occupancy and your tier benefits to confirm if a waiver can be applied at 10:00. I’ll take care of this now.
