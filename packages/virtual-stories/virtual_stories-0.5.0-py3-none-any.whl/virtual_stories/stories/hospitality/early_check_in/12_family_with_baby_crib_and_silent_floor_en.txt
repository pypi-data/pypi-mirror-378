Hello! Our baby fell asleep—any chance of early check‑in if there’s a quiet room?

assistant channel=analysis:
Restate policy, crib availability, quiet side notes.

assistant channel=final:
We’ll do our best. Standard check‑in is 15:00, and early check‑in is subject to availability. Cribs are complimentary—inventory is limited but we can stage one once a room is assigned. For quieter stays, courtyard-facing and higher floors generally help; placement depends on what’s ready.

user:
Can you store our stroller and bags if the room isn’t ready yet?

assistant channel=analysis:
Yes—luggage storage anytime.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—we can store your stroller and bags anytime, and you’re welcome to use the Fitness Center showers from 06:00.

Side note: the koi in your pond captivated our toddler.

Friendly acknowledgment only.

assistant channel=final:
That sounds adorable—little moments like that make travel days.

Is a courtyard-facing king with crib at 10:30 AM subject to a fee, and how much exactly?

Exact fee not in context; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’m syncing the exact pricing for a courtyard-facing king at 10:30 AM with today’s availability. I’ll process this immediately.
