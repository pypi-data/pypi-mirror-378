Hi, I need a quick mental break from coding. Do you have any light, fun books that won't take too much time?

Found two quick reads available. The Wiking book is perfect for a humorous, quick break.

assistant channel=final:
I'd recommend "The Little Book of Lykke" by Meik Wiking - it's a quick, humorous read about happiness that should take about 20-30 minutes. We also have "Why We Sleep" by Matthew Walker if you want something more insightful. Both are perfect for a coding break!
