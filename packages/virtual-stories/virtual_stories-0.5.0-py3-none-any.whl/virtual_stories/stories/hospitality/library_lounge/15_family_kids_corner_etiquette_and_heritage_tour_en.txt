Hi there! Do you have a kids’ area? My two would love to flip through atlases.

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide Kids’ Corner details and etiquette.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the Kids’ Corner is just inside the Lounge: low shelves with picture books and travel atlases, two floor cushions, and a small table. We keep it quiet‑play only, with soft voices and devices on silent.

user:
Sounds perfect. The garden outside looks peaceful.

Small talk acknowledgment without adding external facts.

assistant channel=final:
It does add a gentle backdrop. If you’d like more space, the sofa bay next to the Kids’ Corner works well for families.

user:
When are the heritage micro‑tours, and how do we sign up?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide times and sign‑up details.

assistant channel=final:
They run at 10:00 and 16:00, leaving from the Lounge door. Just add your names at the concierge desk—capacity is 8 and it’s recommended for ages 7 and up.

user:
Is it okay if we bring hot soup cups for the kids while we read?

assistant channel=analysis:
No hot food; wrapped snacks OK.

assistant channel=final:
We ask that hot food stay outside the Lounge. Wrapped snacks are fine, and we have lemon water with paper cups if that helps.

user:
Could you arrange a private bedtime storytelling session with a local author just for our family tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; trigger special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That sounds lovely. Working on your request.
