Hi! We’re a small study group. Can we reserve a communal table for three hours this afternoon?

assistant channel=analysis:
Booking rules allow up to 2 hours per party per day. Offer two 60‑minute slots (or one 120‑minute slot), not three hours.

assistant channel=final:
We can reserve a communal table in 60‑minute blocks, up to 2 hours per party per day. If you’d like, I can hold one table from 14:00–16:00, and the reservation will lapse if not claimed within 10 minutes.

user:
That works. Any fully step‑free path? One of us uses a wheelchair.

assistant channel=analysis:
Describe step‑free route and aisle clearance.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—there’s a step‑free route directly from the lifts, and tactile wayfinding strips lead to the Lounge door. Around the tables you’ll have 90 cm aisle clearance. I can also place you by one of the height‑adjustable desks if that’s more comfortable.

user:
Appreciate it. The espresso cart sounds fun—do you recommend the afternoon pass?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, affirm the timing.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a nice mid‑day pick‑me‑up—the cart usually passes around 15:30, and service completes within about 15 minutes.

user:
Can we use an extension reel for laptops?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide availability info.

assistant channel=final:
Certainly—I can set an extension reel from the floor boxes to your table before you arrive.

user:
Could you allocate a closed‑door private room adjacent to the Lounge for an extra hour after 16:00?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope—no private rooms are defined in system prompt for allocation. Trigger special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I see the need for a private space after your booking. Exploring different approaches.
