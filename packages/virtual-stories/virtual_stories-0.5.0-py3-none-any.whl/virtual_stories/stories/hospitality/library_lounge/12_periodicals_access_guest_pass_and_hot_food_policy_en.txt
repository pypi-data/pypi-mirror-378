Hey there! This space is gorgeous—love the woodwork. Do you keep yesterday’s newspapers? My friend might join too.

assistant channel=analysis:
Compliment acknowledgment small talk; answer about periodicals and prior issues; mention access rules about guests only, no passes.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—those oak details do make it feel warm. Today’s broadsheets are on the central rack, and we keep binders with the last seven days behind the concierge. I can bring you yesterday’s edition for in‑lounge use. Just a note: access is for overnight guests only, so your friend would need to be checked in to join here.

user:
Ah, understood. Where are the quietest seats if I’m skimming magazines?

assistant channel=analysis:
Recommend carrels with dividers; Quiet Hours window.

assistant channel=final:
The carrels with privacy dividers along the inner wall are the quietest, with USB‑A and USB‑C ports. It’s especially serene during Quiet Hours from 21:00 to 23:00.

user:
Can I bring a salad bowl from the café?

assistant channel=analysis:
Food policy: cool odorless snacks allowed; no takeaway boxes or hot food; a salad bowl likely counts as takeaway box—disallow.

assistant channel=final:
We ask that takeaway boxes and hot food stay outside the Lounge. If you have a small, cool, odorless snack in a closed container, that’s fine. Covered non‑alcoholic drinks are welcome.

user:
What’s the Wi‑Fi login again?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide SSID and login.

assistant channel=final:
The SSID is Harborlight_Mezz; log in with your room surname and the last four digits of your booking number.

user:
Could you arrange a temporary guest pass so my local colleague can browse the archives section with me this evening?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope relative to access rules: no external day visitors or guest passes. Trigger special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand the request. Analyzing the situation.
