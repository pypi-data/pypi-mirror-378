Explain 24‑hour folio alignment and grace period.

Parking aligns with your room folio in 24‑hour blocks, with a 20‑minute grace after our 12:00 PM checkout. If you exit at 1:00 PM, a small overtime applies at $6 per 30 minutes beyond the grace.

Do you offer rooftop clearance measuring tools or foam guards I can borrow?
