Impressive! By the way, do you have any wine recommendations to pair with fruit?

For fruit platters, our sommelier recommends a chilled Sauternes or a late-harvest Riesling. However, for specific pairings beyond our standard recommendations, I'd need to consult our wine expert.

Actually, I was wondering about the history of fruit carving techniques.
