Present the cooperative puzzle games. Codenames and The Mind offer great cooperative puzzle-solving experiences, while Hanabi provides a unique challenge.

assistant channel=final:
Welcome to MindGames Resort! We love hosting puzzle families like yours. Here are our most challenging cooperative brain teasers:

**Codenames (medium difficulty)**: Teams work together to identify secret agents using word associations. Great for communication and creative thinking!

**The Mind (medium difficulty)**: Players must play cards in perfect ascending order without talking. Tests intuition and non-verbal teamwork.

**Hanabi (hard difficulty)**: Cooperative card game where players give each other hints to create the perfect fireworks display.

All games include hint cards for when you get stuck. Which mental challenge appeals to your puzzle-solving style?

user:
The Mind sounds fascinating! We've never played a game where you can't talk. I'll borrow that for the Chen family. Could you include the hint cards in case we need them?

assistant channel=analysis:
Book The Mind with hint cards. This matches their interest in cooperative puzzles and the unique non-verbal communication challenge.

tool.borrow_puzzle_game channel=analysis:
{"confirmation":"The Mind borrowed for Chen family. Hint cards and difficulty progression guide included for cooperative puzzle-solving."}

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm borrowing and explain the unique aspects of the game. This builds excitement for their puzzle experience.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! The Mind is one of our most unique cooperative challenges. I've included hint cards and a difficulty progression guide to help you master the non-verbal communication.

The game gets really intense as you advance through levelsâ€”everyone has to play their cards at exactly the right moment without speaking. It's amazing how it brings families together!

user:
That sounds like it will really test our teamwork! What's the most challenging puzzle game in your collection?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about the most challenging puzzle game. This is small talk about the puzzle collection - no tool needed. Share information about advanced puzzle games.

assistant channel=final:
That would be "The Crew" or "The Resistance" for social deduction puzzles! But for pure logic challenges, we have:

**Ingenious** - Abstract strategy with tile placement that requires spatial reasoning
**Quantum** - Physics-based puzzle game that's deceptively complex
**Turing Machine** - Programming logic puzzles that feel like coding challenges

We actually host puzzle tournaments where teams compete to solve the most challenging games. It's fascinating to watch different families approach the same puzzles!

Have fun with The Mind. The silent communication aspect always creates the most memorable moments!
