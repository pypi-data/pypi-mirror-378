Hi! We’ve got kids ages 7 and 12 and want something cooperative—no arguing over winners tonight. Also, the lobby smells like cinnamon—nice touch!

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge scent small talk. Suggest cooperative options under ~45 minutes that fit 2–5+ players. Then ask if they want rule help.

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer two strong picks (Zombie Kidz Evolution and Forbidden Island) and mention The Mind as quick filler. Include cinnamon small talk reply.

assistant channel=final:
You’re catching our bakery cinnamon sticks—we set them out by the fireplace most afternoons. For a calm, team‑based night, I recommend:
- Zombie Kidz Evolution (ages 7+, 2–4 players, ~20 min)
- Forbidden Island (ages 10+, 2–4 players, ~30 min)
- The Mind (ages 8+, 2–4 players, ~15 min) as a quick warm‑up

Would you like me to send one up and briefly walk you through the rules?

user:
Let’s do Zombie Kidz Evolution first, and a quick rules intro would be great. Reservation is RSV55221. Could we start at 6:30?

assistant channel=analysis:
Borrow the game to the room with a 10 PM return, and schedule a 20‑minute facilitation at 6:30 PM.

Confirm both actions and give meeting point. Offer to hold Forbidden Island as a backup.

assistant channel=final:
All set! I’ve reserved Zombie Kidz Evolution (item GN-014) to your room—please return by 10:00 PM. Maya will meet you at the Game Nook at 6:30 PM for a 20‑minute rules kickoff. Want me to hold Forbidden Island as your next game?

user:
Yes, please hold it. Thanks for making this easy.

assistant channel=analysis:
Close warmly, no tool needed.

assistant channel=final:
My pleasure—have a fantastic team night by the lake! I’ll keep Forbidden Island on standby.
