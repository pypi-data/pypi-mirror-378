Can I get a 55" confidence monitor at the foot of the stage with a countdown timer?

assistant channel=analysis:
Matches inventory and support hours.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we’ll place the 55" monitor on a rolling stand with a 25 ft HDMI run, plus a digital countdown timer with remote. On-call support is available until 21:00.

user:
Mind if we angle it 20 degrees and keep the bottom edge just below eye line?

Placement detail is fine.

We can set that angle and height; we’ll tape the cable run and include a spare HDMI.

Can you share the detailed staff scheduling logs for stagehands assigned to my slot?

Beyond kit; escalate and end.
