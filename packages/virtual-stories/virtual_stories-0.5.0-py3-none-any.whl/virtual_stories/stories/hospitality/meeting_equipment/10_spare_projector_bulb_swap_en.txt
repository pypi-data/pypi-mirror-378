Hi—projector in the Roebling Hall looks dim. Espresso cart smells great.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge espresso; swap bulb for PJ-2.

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm completion and recalibration.

assistant channel=final:
That’s our medium roast. We’ve swapped the bulb on PJ-2 in 9 minutes and recalibrated brightness and focus. You should see crisp slides again—ready for the next session.

user:
Looks perfect now—thanks.

assistant channel=final:
Glad to hear it. We’ll keep a spare staged just in case.
