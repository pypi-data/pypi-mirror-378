Hi! It feels a bit warm in my room 1421. Could you set the A/C to 20°C on low fan?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm current status, then apply 20 °C cool with low fan. Values are within allowed range.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_hvac_status:
{"room_number":"1421"}

tool.get_hvac_status channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"room_number":"1421","temperature_c":24.0,"mode":"auto","fan_speed":"medium","online":true}

assistant channel=analysis:
Room 1421 is at 24 °C, mode auto, fan medium. Apply cool 20 °C, fan low.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.set_hvac_settings:
{"room_number":"1421","target_temp_c":20,"mode":"cool","fan_speed":"low"}

tool.set_hvac_settings channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"applied":true,"effective_temp_c":20.0,"mode":"cool","fan_speed":"low","estimated_stabilization_minutes":15}

assistant channel=final:
All set—room 1421 is now on cool, low fan, targeting 20 °C. It should feel comfortable in about 15 minutes. If it doesn’t stabilize, I can open an engineering ticket.

user:
By the way, the harbor looks amazing from here tonight.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk response drawing from hotel identity only; no tool use needed.

assistant channel=final:
It does look amazing from here at Harborview Grand. Enjoy the harbor view!

user:
Could you arrange a whale-watching tour for tomorrow morning?
