Just got back from Angel's Landing trail and my hiking boots are completely caked with red mud! Do you have a good sponge that can handle this desert clay?

Adventure guest with heavily muddy hiking boots from desert trail. Need heavy-duty sponge suitable for red clay mud removal from hiking equipment.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! Angel's Landing is notorious for that red clay. We have heavy-duty trail sponges with reinforced scrubbing surfaces specifically designed for desert mud. They work great with minimal water too. What's your room number for the cleaning station access?

user:
Room 540. Are the cleaning stations heated? It's getting chilly now that the sun's going down.

Yes! Gear Station Alpha is heated and ready for you with heavy-duty sponges and boot brushes. The covered area will keep you warm while you clean, and there are drying racks for your boots overnight. The desert temperature drops can be surprising!
