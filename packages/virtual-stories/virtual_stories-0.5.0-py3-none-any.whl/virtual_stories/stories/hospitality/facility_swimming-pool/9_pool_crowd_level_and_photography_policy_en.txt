Can I bring a drone for aerial shots?

Drone usage isn’t specified—flag attention.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I don’t see drone guidelines in the pool policy. I’ll confirm restrictions.

Thanks—shade sails sound great today.

assistant channel=analysis:
Respond with brief chitchat.

They help a lot in the afternoon heat.
