Hi—can you make the shower feel more like strong rainfall in 1412?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check PSI, then set high pressure with wide_rainfall.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.check_water_pressure:
{"room_number":"1412","fixture_type":"shower","measurement_type":"pressure_psi"}

tool.check_water_pressure channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"room_number":"1412","current_pressure_psi":53,"status":"within_range"}

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.adjust_shower_settings:
{"room_number":"1412","pressure_setting":"high","spray_pattern":"wide_rainfall"}

tool.adjust_shower_settings channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"room_number":"1412","pressure_setting":"high","spray_pattern":"wide_rainfall","applied":true}

assistant channel=final:
Done—your shower in 1412 is set to high pressure with a wide rainfall pattern. Give it a try and enjoy the cooldown.

user:
Nice! Are you still available if I need help at 8:30 pm?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use engineering availability from system.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—engineering is on until 21:00, with urgent on-call support afterward.

user:
Any tips for sunset trails tomorrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
Trail recommendations are beyond system.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I acknowledge your question about trail tips and will review options.
