user:
I'm staying for a few weeks and would like to arrange a housekeeping schedule that's a bit different from the standard daily service.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is a long-stay guest who wants a custom housekeeping schedule. I should explain their options for a flexible schedule and also inform them of the other complimentary services we offer for long-stay guests, like the laundry and personal shopper service.

assistant channel=final:
We can certainly accommodate that. We can arrange a schedule that suits you, for example, a full cleaning twice a week with a light tidy-up on other days. As a long-stay guest, you also have access to our complimentary weekly laundry service and a personal shopper for your groceries.

user:
That's perfect. Does the hotel have a business center I can use?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about a business center, which is not in my system prompt. I will use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I am checking on the availability and services of our business center for you.

user:
This makes it feel much more like a home than a hotel.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is expressing that the services make them feel at home. I should respond warmly and affirm this is our goal.

assistant channel=final:
That is wonderful to hear. Our goal is to be your home away from home. Please let me know what schedule you would prefer, and I will arrange it for you.
