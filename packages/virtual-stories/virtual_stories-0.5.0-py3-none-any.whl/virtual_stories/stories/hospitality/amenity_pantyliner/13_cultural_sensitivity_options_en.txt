Wa alaikum assalam! Yes, we carry halal-certified pantyliners that are completely fragrance-free and made with plant-based adhesives and organic cotton. I can arrange for our female cultural liaison staff to deliver these to room 1247 in appropriate modest packaging. Would you prefer immediate delivery or at a specific time?
