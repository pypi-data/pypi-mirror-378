I'm fascinated by Chinese language and culture. Could you tell me the Chinese name of your hotel and what it means?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is interested in the cultural and linguistic aspects of the Chinese name. I should use the brand names tool to get the official Chinese name and then provide detailed character meanings and cultural context.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_brand_names:
{"brand_id":"starhaven_waterfront","language":"zh"}

tool.get_brand_names channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"name":"星灣濱水酒店"}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool provided the official Chinese name. I can now provide detailed character meanings and cultural context from the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
The official Chinese name is 「星灣濱水酒店」. Each character has specific meaning: 星 (star), 灣 (bay), 濱 (waterfront), 水 (water), and 酒店 (hotel). The name creates a poetic description of our location by the star-shaped bay and waterfront setting. This reflects traditional Chinese appreciation for natural beauty and geographical features, where each character carries specific meaning to create a harmonious whole.

user:
That's beautiful! The way Chinese characters combine to create meaning is so elegant. The star and bay references really capture the essence of your waterfront location.

assistant channel=final:
Exactly! The Chinese name beautifully captures our hotel's essence through its linguistic poetry. The combination of 星灣 (star bay) and 濱水 (waterfront) creates an image that resonates with both the physical location and the traditional Chinese appreciation for natural harmony.

user:
What are the current Chinese language learning programs offered at the hotel?
