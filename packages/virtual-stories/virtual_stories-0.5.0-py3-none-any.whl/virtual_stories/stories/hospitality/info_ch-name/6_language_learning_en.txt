user:
I'm learning Chinese and would love to practice pronouncing your hotel's Chinese name. What is it and how do you say it?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is a Chinese language learner interested in pronunciation practice. I should use the brand names tool to get the official Chinese name and provide pronunciation guidance.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_brand_names:
{"brand_id":"starhaven_waterfront","language":"zh"}

tool.get_brand_names channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"name":"星灣濱水酒店"}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool provided the official Chinese name. I can now provide pronunciation guidance and learning context for the language student.

assistant channel=final:
The official Chinese name is 「星灣濱水酒店」. The pronunciation in Pinyin is "Xīng Wān Bīn Shuǐ Jiǔ Diàn". Each character represents a syllable with specific tone and meaning: 星 (xīng - star), 灣 (wān - bay), 濱 (bīn - waterfront), 水 (shuǐ - water), and 酒店 (jiǔ diàn - hotel). This is great practice for understanding how Chinese names combine characters to create meaning!

user:
That's perfect for my studies! The breakdown of each character really helps me understand the structure. The tones are challenging but I'll keep practicing.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful! Chinese names are excellent for language learning because they combine practical vocabulary with cultural understanding. The way each character carries specific meaning while working together to create the full name is a beautiful aspect of the language.

user:
What are the current Chinese language proficiency test scores required for hotel staff positions?

[ATTENTION] I don't have access to current hiring requirements and language proficiency standards. Checking available options.
