Hello! I just arrived for a business conference and I'm feeling quite stressed from travel. Could you help me book a relaxing spa treatment for this afternoon?

Perfect timing for some well-deserved relaxation! Our Oceanview Wellness Sanctuary has two excellent afternoon options: Isabella's signature aromatherapy massage at 2:30 PM or Chen's hot stone therapy at 4:00 PM, both 90 minutes overlooking the Pacific. Which would help you unwind better?
