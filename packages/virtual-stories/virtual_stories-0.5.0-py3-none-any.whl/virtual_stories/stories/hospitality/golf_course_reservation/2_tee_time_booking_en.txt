I'm an avid golfer, and I was hoping to play a round tomorrow. Can you help me book a tee time?

The user wants to book a tee time for tomorrow. I should first check the availability.

tool.get_golf_course_availability channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"available_times": ["08:00", "08:30", "09:00", "10:00", "10:30", "11:00"]}

assistant channel=analysis:
I have the available tee times. I will present them to the user.

assistant channel=final:
We would be delighted to arrange that for you. Our course is in beautiful condition right now. Here are the available tee times for tomorrow:

Do any of those times work for you?

The 9:00 AM time would be perfect. There will be two of us playing. My name is Michael Thompson. I've heard great things about your course!

assistant channel=analysis:
The user wants to book a 9:00 AM tee time for two players. I will use the `book_tee_time` tool to make the reservation and also respond to their comment.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.book_tee_time:
{"guest_name": "Michael Thompson", "time": "09:00", "number_of_players": 2}

We're very proud of our course, and we're so glad you've heard good things! I've booked your tee time for two players tomorrow at 9:00 AM, Mr. Thompson. You can check in at the pro shop 15 minutes before your tee time. Enjoy your round!
