user:
Excellent! The GPS will definitely help me play better. What's the most popular cart feature for your guests?

assistant channel=analysis:
Golfer is asking about popular cart features. This is small talk about cart preferences - no tool needed. Share information about guest preferences.

assistant channel=final:
By far, the GPS navigation system is the most popular feature! Guests tell us it:

**Improves their game** - Knowing exact distances to greens and hazards
**Reduces stress** - No more guessing yardages or getting lost
**Saves time** - Direct routing to the next tee
**Builds confidence** - Especially for new players or unfamiliar courses

The beverage cooler comes in a close secondâ€”nothing beats an ice-cold drink on a hot day! We also get a lot of love for the phone chargers, which keep everyone connected.

Your GPS cart will definitely enhance your golf experience. Enjoy the round!
