user:
That sounds wonderful! He's been watching golf on TV and thinks it's cool. What's the most popular activity for kids in the camp?

assistant channel=analysis:
Parent is asking about popular camp activities for kids. This is small talk about youth golf programs - no tool needed. Share information about what kids enjoy most.

assistant channel=final:
Kids absolutely love the "golf obstacle course" where they navigate through fun challenges like:

**Giant Golf Ball Toss** - Throwing soft balls into oversized cups
**Putting Through Hoops** - Like basketball but with golf balls and hoops
**Chipping Target Practice** - Hitting balls at colorful targets
**Mini Golf Holes** - Playing tiny versions of famous course holes

The obstacle course turns skill-building into a game, and we often hear kids saying "that was so much fun!" rather than "that was hard work." It's all about creating positive associations with golf.

Tommy is going to have a blast discovering the game. You'll probably see a little golfer in the making!
