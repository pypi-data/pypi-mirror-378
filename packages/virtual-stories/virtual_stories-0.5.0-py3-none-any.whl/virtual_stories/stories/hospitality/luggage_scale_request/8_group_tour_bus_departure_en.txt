Hi! Our bus leaves in 25 minutes—can we cycle 8 people through a scale quickly?

assistant channel=analysis:
Queue for group "Midwest Art Tour", 8 guests, 20-minute window to finish before :30. Light small talk about lobby music.

Give directions and timing.

You’re in rhythm—our pianist just switched to jazz standards. I’ve queued your 8 guests at station STL-SS-2 for a 20‑minute window. The bus bay is through the south doors; you’ll be set before the :30 departure.

user:
Wonderful—thanks for orchestrating.

assistant channel=final:
My pleasure. I’ll keep the line moving and page you if we’re ahead of schedule.
