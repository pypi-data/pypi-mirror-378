Morning! Is there a place where we can repack and weigh our bags without being in the way?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer Mezzanine Family Lounge tables and Bell Desk scales; include hours and supplies. Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Good morning! The Family Lounge on Mezzanine Level is perfect for that—plenty of table space and it’s open 08:00–22:00. When you’re ready to weigh, the Bell Desk on Lobby Level has two digital scales (±50 g) and a portable hanging scale. We can also escort your bags down—usually a 5–10 minute wait. Would tape or a loaner tote help with the re-pack?

user:
Yes, tape and a tote would be great. Can I borrow scissors too?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm supplies and scissors via Concierge with ID hold.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—tape and a 15 L tote are available at the Bell Desk, and we can lend scissors at the Concierge Desk with a quick ID hold. I’ll note your room so the team can set them aside.

user:
One more thing—can you confirm the baggage dimension limits for our carrier’s basic fare?

assistant channel=analysis:
Carrier dimension limits are beyond system context. Use special flag.
