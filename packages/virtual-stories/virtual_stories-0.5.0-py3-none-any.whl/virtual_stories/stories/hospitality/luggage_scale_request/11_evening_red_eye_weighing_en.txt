Hi there—catching a red-eye tonight. Do you happen to have a luggage scale I can use?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm availability and provide nearest options with hours. Offer in-room portable scale and tips. Include small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Good evening! Yes—we’ve got you covered. The quickest options right now are:
- Bell Desk on Lobby Level until 23:00
- Fitness Center entrance on Floor 3 until 23:00 (flat weighing mat, up to 40 kg)
If you’d prefer, I can also send our bell team with a portable hanging scale to your room—no fee, usually a 5–10 minute ETA within the Lobby Tower. Traveling on a red-eye can be a sprint; want me to dispatch a scale to you now?

user:
Thanks! If I’m a little over, do you have any tape or a small tote so I can split items?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from policy: tape and small totes are available at Bell Desk. Add friendly tone and travel tip.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely. The Bell Desk keeps complimentary packing tape and a few 15 L fabric totes for quick repacks. A handy tip: if you’re using the Floor 3 mat, hold the handle steady for 3 seconds to lock the reading—saves re-weighing.

user:
Nice! Also, what’s the overweight fee on my airline to SFO if I’m at 24.3 kg?

assistant channel=analysis:
Airline fees aren’t in our system context. End the dialogue using the special flag, with a neutral processing statement.
