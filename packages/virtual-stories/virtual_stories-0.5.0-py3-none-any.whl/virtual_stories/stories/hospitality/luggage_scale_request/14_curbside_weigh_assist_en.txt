system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Night Supervisor may authorize curbside weighing by Bell staff at the rideshare zone during 19:00–22:00 surge. Equipment: portable hanging scale, reflective vests required. Safety: do not weigh in active traffic lanes; use the coned loading area.

user:
Hi—my driver’s 3 minutes away. Can someone help weigh my suitcase at the curb?

assistant channel=analysis:
Authorize curbside weighing; mention safety and equipment.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we can meet you at the coned loading area by the rideshare zone. Our bell team will bring a portable hanging scale and reflective vests. It’s quick—about a 30-second check as long as we stay inside the cones.

user:
Great, thanks! Can you also tell me if my airline waives the fee for elite status?

assistant channel=analysis:
Airline elite fee waivers are beyond system context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Analyzing the situation.
