Hello! Could we borrow a corner to weigh five bags and do a quick repack before our airport shuttle?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer Meeting Nook A with 20-minute limit; mention equipment and supplies.

assistant channel=final:
Certainly—we can hold Meeting Nook A for a 20-minute window near the Lobby Bookshelf. The Bell Desk will set out two digital scales, a hanging scale, tape, and a few 15 L totes so everyone can adjust quickly. Late morning to mid-afternoon is least crowded—does 13:30 work for your group?

user:
Perfect. By the way, is there any way to prepay airline overweight charges here?

assistant channel=analysis:
Prepaying airline fees is beyond system context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Reviewing available resources.
