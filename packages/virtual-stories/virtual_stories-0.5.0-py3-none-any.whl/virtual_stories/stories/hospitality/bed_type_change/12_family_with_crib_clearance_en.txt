Hi! Can we switch from one king to two twins so there’s space for a crib?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm availability and safety clearance; crib placement guidance.

assistant channel=final:
We can change to a two‑twin configuration between 10:00 and 16:00. We’ll keep required clearance for the patio door and detector access, and place the crib along the interior wall away from the AC. Would you like hypoallergenic bedding as well?

user:
Yes please. Also, can the crib have a breathable liner?

assistant channel=analysis:
Breathable liner availability not stated; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for your question. Checking available options.
