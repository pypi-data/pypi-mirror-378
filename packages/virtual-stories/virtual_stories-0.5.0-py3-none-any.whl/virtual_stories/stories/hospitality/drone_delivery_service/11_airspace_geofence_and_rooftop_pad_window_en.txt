system:
Property: Skyline Harbor Hotel. Drone delivery pads: Rooftop Pad A (primary), Pad B (overflow). Delivery window: 10:00–20:00 daily. Airspace geofence radius: 500 meters horizontal from pad center; minimum altitude corridor 20–60 meters AGL; final approach vector aligned harbor‑side to minimize downdraft near balconies. Compliance: Part 107 operations required; pilots check in at Concierge. Weight limit per parcel: 2.0 kg. Hazard buffer: 8 meters around pad during touchdown. Guest handoff: Concierge verifies name and room, then escorts to secure vestibule L19 for pickup. Storage: non‑perishables can be held up to 6 hours in secured locker; perishables not accepted. Notification: SMS + in‑room phone message when landed. Weather hold protocol: approach is paused; next attempt scheduled within the same window if winds exceed threshold.

user:
Hi! Love the rooftop views—how’s your day going up here?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, then gather delivery need and explain window/geofence.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a bright day and the harbor’s calm—thanks for asking! What are you having delivered and when are you expecting it?

user:
A tiny camera rig under 2 kilos. Is your pad open now and are there airspace limits I should know?

assistant channel=analysis:
Reference 10:00–20:00 window, geofence 500m, altitude corridor.

assistant channel=final:
Our drone pads operate from 10:00 to 20:00 daily. Flights must stay within our 500‑meter geofence and use the 20–60 m AGL corridor on approach, aligned to the harbor side.

user:
Do you accept perishables if they’re insulated?

assistant channel=analysis:
System says perishables not accepted.

assistant channel=final:
We don’t accept perishables for drone drop‑offs here. Non‑perishables can be held in a secure locker for up to 6 hours.

user:
Could you pull up the live harbor wind map and tell me the gusts near Pad A right now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond the provided system context; use the special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Harbor wind specifics require additional verification. Reviewing available resources.
