Could you provide a completely sealed, disposable tooth mug instead?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about disposable sealed mugs, which goes beyond our standard ceramic and glass options. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since disposable sealed mugs aren't covered in our system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you'd prefer a sealed disposable mug. Reviewing available resources.
