Could you also provide a specialized toothbrush holder that's easier to use?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about specialized toothbrush holders, which goes beyond our tooth mug services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since toothbrush holder accommodations aren't covered in our system knowledge.
