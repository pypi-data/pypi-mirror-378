Property: Skyline Harbor Hotel. Photography access: 17:00–19:30 with escort. Capacity: up to 4 guests per slot. Weather: shifts within the same day permitted if pad operations (10:00–20:00) remain active. Safety: 8 m buffer; no balcony overflight.

user:
Hi! Can we do a team of four today if the clouds break?

assistant channel=analysis:
Affirm capacity; mention weather shift.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—four guests is our maximum and works perfectly. If conditions change, we can shift your slot later in the same day while pads are active.

user:
Is there a fee to reschedule within the day?

assistant channel=analysis:
System does not mention fees; avoid adding facts—simply confirm shift allowed.

assistant channel=final:
We can adjust within the same day while pad operations are active. I’ll manage the timing for you.

user:
Could you pull cloud base and visibility values right now for planning?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Cloud base and visibility details require external sources. Reviewing available resources.
