user:
Hi! The sunset looks promising—how are things on your end?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, then discuss window and escort.

assistant channel=final:
All good here—clear skies make for great light. We can escort you for rooftop access between 17:00 and 19:30, with an 8‑meter buffer from the pads.

user:
Can I bring two friends and a tripod?

assistant channel=analysis:
Capacity up to 4, tripod allowed implicitly.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—our capacity is up to four photography guests per slot, and a tripod is fine as long as staff can position it outside the buffer.

user:
Could you tell me the exact sunset time and cloud cover percentage right now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for your question about sunset time and cloud cover. Searching for more information.
