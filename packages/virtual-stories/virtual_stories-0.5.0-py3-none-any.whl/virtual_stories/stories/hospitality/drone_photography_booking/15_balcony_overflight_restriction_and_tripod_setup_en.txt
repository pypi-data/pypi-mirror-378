Hey! Love the brass fixtures in the elevator—very vintage.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, then rules.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—those fixtures are guest favorites. For your session, we’ll keep tripods outside the 8‑meter buffer, and flights can’t pass over guest balconies at any time.

user:
Could you set the tripod on the windward side so my pans are smoother?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer escort assistance.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—our escort will help you place it on the most stable spot, considering wind direction.

user:
One last thing—can you stream the live harbor camera feed to my phone so I can time the shot?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Live harbor video access requires coordination. Checking available options.
