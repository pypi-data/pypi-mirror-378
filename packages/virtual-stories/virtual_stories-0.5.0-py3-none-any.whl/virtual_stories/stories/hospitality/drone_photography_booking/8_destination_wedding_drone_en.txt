Hello! We're getting married here in two weeks and we want to capture our special day with drone photography. Can you tell us about your wedding packages?

The guest is planning a destination wedding and wants drone photography packages. I should get the available packages first.

The Luxury Paradise Package sounds incredible! We want to include the underwater shots too. Our ceremony is on October 28th at 4:00 PM and reception at 6:00 PM.

assistant channel=analysis:
The couple wants the luxury package with underwater shots. I should book this with their specific timing.

{"booking_id":"WEDDING-DRONE-2025-1028","status":"confirmed","photographer":"Sarah Chen","package_details":"Luxury Paradise Package confirmed with underwater drone option"}

assistant channel=analysis:
The booking is confirmed. I should provide the details and mention the weather contingency for our tropical location.

assistant channel=final:
Oh, how perfect! The Luxury Paradise Package will create absolutely breathtaking memories of your special day. I've booked Sarah Chen, our expert wedding photographer, for October 28th. She'll capture your 4:00 PM ceremony, the underwater moments, and continue through your 6:00 PM reception with sunset shots. Your booking reference is WEDDING-DRONE-2025-1028. In the Maldives, we sometimes get brief showers - would you like me to arrange indoor backup options?

user:
That's a great idea. The underwater shots are going to be so unique! By the way, I've heard the sunsets here are incredible.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is making small talk about sunsets and commenting on the underwater photography. This is casual conversation that doesn't require tools.

assistant channel=final:
They truly are! Our sunsets over the Indian Ocean are legendary - Sarah will capture the most romantic light for your photos. The underwater drone shots will be magical too, especially with the crystal-clear waters around our resort. I can already picture how stunning your wedding album will be!

user:
We're so excited! Is there anything specific we should know about the underwater photography process?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the underwater photography process. I can provide information based on the resort's services from the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! Our underwater drone is specially equipped for weddings and operates in shallow, calm waters. Sarah will coordinate with your photographer to get shots of the ceremony from the water's surface and just below. You'll want to wear waterproof accessories if you have any, and she'll guide you through the best poses. The results are simply breathtaking - we've had many couples tell us it's their favorite part of the whole day!

user:
That sounds amazing. Thank you for all your help making our wedding day perfect!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is concluding the conversation positively. I should wrap up warmly.

assistant channel=final:
You're so welcome! It's going to be a truly magical day, and I can't wait to hear about it. Sarah will work closely with you to make every moment perfect. If you need any other special touches for your celebration, just let me know. Wishing you both a lifetime of happiness!
