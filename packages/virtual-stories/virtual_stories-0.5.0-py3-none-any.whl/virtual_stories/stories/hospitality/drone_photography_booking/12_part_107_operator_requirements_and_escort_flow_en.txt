Hey! Big fan of your lobby art. Quick one on drone credentials.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk and requirements.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—we love those pieces too. For rooftop drone photography, we’ll confirm your Part 107 status at Concierge, then escort you with an 8‑meter buffer from the pads.

user:
If my spotter isn’t Part 107, is that okay?

assistant channel=analysis:
Only operator needs Part 107; not specified otherwise. Keep within system facts.

assistant channel=final:
We verify the operator’s Part 107 credentials. Your spotter can assist under your supervision during the escorted session.

Could you confirm today’s TFR notices in the area before I fly?

Beyond system; special flag and end.

[ATTENTION] Local airspace notices and TFR status need verification. Searching for more information.
