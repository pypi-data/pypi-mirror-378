user:
This is exactly what I was hoping for! I'm also curious about the water temperature and any health benefits for people with mobility challenges.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about water temperature and health benefits for people with mobility challenges. I have information about our water temperature and therapeutic benefits in my system prompt that I can share.

assistant channel=final:
The water temperature is maintained at 104°F (40°C), which is perfect for muscle relaxation and circulation - especially beneficial for people with mobility challenges. The warm mineral water helps reduce muscle tension, improves circulation, and can provide significant pain relief. The buoyancy of the water also reduces pressure on joints and muscles, making movement easier and more comfortable. Many guests with mobility challenges find that regular hot spring sessions help with flexibility, pain management, and overall well-being. The mineral content, particularly the magnesium and sulfur, has anti-inflammatory properties that can be very helpful for chronic pain conditions.

user:
That sounds incredibly therapeutic! I'm really looking forward to this experience. Thank you for being so accommodating.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is expressing gratitude and excitement about their upcoming experience. This is a nice chitchat moment where I can be encouraging and provide some final reassurance about their visit.

assistant channel=final:

You'll receive a confirmation email with all the details, including what to expect and how to prepare. Our staff will be ready to assist you with anything you need, and I'm confident you'll have a wonderful, relaxing experience. We can't wait to welcome you on Saturday!
