Hi! I'm a travel influencer and I'd love to create some content at your hot spring. What are your photography policies for social media?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is a travel influencer asking about photography policies specifically for social media content. I should get comprehensive information about our social media photography policies and guidelines.

{"social_media_policy": "Permitted with proper tagging and community guidelines", "requirements": ["Tag @InstagramSpringsResort", "Use hashtags #HotSpringWellness #NaturalHealing #ResortLife", "Respect other guests' privacy", "No inappropriate content"], "restrictions": ["No photography in changing rooms or private areas", "No disruptive behavior", "Guest consent required for group photos"], "equipment": "Waterproof camera storage available, no tripods in water areas"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Perfect! I have the social media photography policies. I should also get information about the best photo spots to help the influencer plan their content creation.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_photo_spots:
{"time_of_day": "all"}

tool.get_photo_spots channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"best_spots": ["Sunrise over the hot spring", "Waterfall feature", "Natural stone seating areas", "Covered pavilion"], "lighting": ["Golden hour (6-7 AM, 6-7 PM)", "Soft morning light", "Dramatic evening lighting"], "seasonal": ["Spring cherry blossoms", "Summer starlight", "Autumn foliage", "Winter snow scenes"]}

assistant channel=analysis:
Excellent! I have both the photography policies and the best photo spots. I should present this information in a way that helps the influencer understand both the guidelines and the amazing content opportunities available.

assistant channel=final:
We love working with travel influencers! Our social media photography policy is quite flexible - you're welcome to create content as long as you tag us @InstagramSpringsResort and use our hashtags #HotSpringWellness, #NaturalHealing, and #ResortLife. We just ask that you respect other guests' privacy and avoid photography in changing rooms or private areas. For the best content, I'd recommend sunrise shots over the hot spring, our beautiful waterfall feature, and the natural stone seating areas. Golden hour (6-7 AM and 6-7 PM) provides incredible lighting. We also have waterproof camera storage available if you need it.

user:
That sounds perfect! What about commercial photography? I might want to do some sponsored content.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about commercial photography for sponsored content. I should get information about our commercial photography policies and requirements.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_photography_policy:
{"content_type": "commercial"}

{"commercial_requirements": "Advance booking and permits required", "fees": "Additional fees apply for commercial use", "restrictions": "Professional equipment restrictions in certain areas", "process": "Must submit content plan and get approval before shooting"}

assistant channel=analysis:
I have the commercial photography requirements. I should explain the process and fees while being encouraging about the possibilities for sponsored content.

assistant channel=final:
For sponsored content and commercial photography, we do require advance booking and permits - it's a simple process though! There are additional fees for commercial use, but we offer influencer packages that make it very reasonable. You'll need to submit your content plan for approval before shooting, and there are some equipment restrictions in certain areas to protect the natural environment. We actually have special influencer collaboration programs that include content creation assistance, hashtag optimization, and even editing services. Would you like me to connect you with our marketing team to discuss the details?

user:
That would be amazing! I'm also curious about the best times for different types of shots. What would you recommend for lifestyle content?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the best times for lifestyle content photography. I should get information about different time periods and their suitability for various types of content.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_photo_spots:
{"time_of_day": "all", "style": "lifestyle"}

tool.get_photo_spots channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"lifestyle_times": {"morning": "Soft, natural lighting perfect for wellness content", "afternoon": "Bright, energetic lighting for active lifestyle shots", "evening": "Dramatic lighting for romantic or relaxing content", "sunset": "Golden hour perfect for aspirational lifestyle content"}, "recommended": "Sunset and morning provide the most Instagram-worthy lighting"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Perfect! I have detailed information about the best times for lifestyle content. I should explain how different times create different moods and appeal to different audiences.

assistant channel=final:
For lifestyle content, timing is everything! Morning sessions (7-9 AM) give you that soft, natural lighting that's perfect for wellness and self-care content - very on-trend right now. Afternoon (2-4 PM) provides bright, energetic lighting that's great for active lifestyle shots. But for the most Instagram-worthy content, I'd recommend sunset sessions (6-7 PM) - the golden hour lighting creates that dreamy, aspirational look that performs really well. Evening sessions (8-9 PM) are perfect for romantic or relaxing content with dramatic lighting. Many influencers find that morning and sunset sessions get the best engagement because they feel more authentic and aspirational.

user:
This is so helpful! Do you have any special photography services or equipment I can use?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about photography services and equipment. I have information about our professional photography services and equipment rental in my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We have a resort photographer available for professional shoots, and we offer photo packages that include editing services and social media optimization. For equipment, we rent professional cameras, waterproof cases, lighting equipment, and even provide access to editing software. We also have photography workshops and seasonal photo contests that are great for content creation. Our influencer packages often include content creation assistance, hashtag optimization, and engagement strategies. Many influencers find that working with our team helps them create more professional content while still maintaining their authentic voice.

user:
That sounds incredible! One more question - are there any seasonal events or special occasions that would be great for content?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about seasonal events and special occasions for content creation. I have information about seasonal photography opportunities and special events in my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
We have amazing seasonal opportunities! Spring brings cherry blossom viewing around the hot spring, summer has stargazing sessions that are perfect for dreamy content, autumn offers beautiful foliage backdrops, and winter creates magical snow scenes. We also host seasonal photo contests, photography workshops, and special events like our Summer Solstice celebration and Winter Wonderland experience. These events are perfect for content because they're unique and create natural storytelling opportunities. Many influencers find that seasonal content performs really well because it's timely and creates anticipation for future visits.

user:
Perfect! This all sounds amazing. I think I'll start with some personal content this weekend and then explore the commercial options.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is planning to start with personal content and then explore commercial options. This is a great approach, and I should be encouraging while providing some final tips for their weekend content creation.

assistant channel=final:
That's a perfect approach! Starting with personal content is a great way to get familiar with the space and see what resonates with your audience. For this weekend, I'd definitely recommend the sunrise session on Saturday and sunset on Sunday - you'll get incredible variety in your content. Don't forget to tag us and use our hashtags! And when you're ready to explore commercial options, just reach out to our marketing team. We love supporting creators and helping them tell their stories. I'm excited to see what you create!
