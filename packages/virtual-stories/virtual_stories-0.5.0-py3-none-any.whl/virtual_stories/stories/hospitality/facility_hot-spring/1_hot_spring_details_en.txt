I'm so excited to try the hot spring! Can you tell me where it is and what the hours are?

We're so glad you're excited! Our natural hot spring is located outdoors, and you can access it through the spa. It's open from 7:00 AM to 11:00 PM every day. Just a friendly reminder, we do ask that all guests shower before entering the hot spring for hygiene purposes, and children under 12 must be accompanied by an adult. It's the perfect way to unwind!

user:
That sounds lovely. Do I need to bring my own towel?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking if they need to bring a towel. This information is not explicitly available in my current knowledge base or tools, but it is a common service. I will acknowledge the question and pass it to a background agent to confirm.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a great question. Let me check on that for you.
