This is amazing! New York is such a melting pot of cultures. By the way, what's your favorite international cuisine spot in the city?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about international cuisine. This doesn't require specific information from my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! New York City's diversity is truly inspiring. I don't have personal favorites since I focus on travel services, but our guests enjoy the incredible variety of international cuisines throughout the city's neighborhoods.

user:
Actually, I was wondering about the history of immigration to New York and how it shaped the city's cultural landscape.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about New York's immigration history, which is detailed historical information not available in my basic system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research New York's immigration history for you.

assistant channel=analysis:
I should offer alternative assistance while the information is being gathered.

assistant channel=final:
While I look into that, I can tell you that New York has been shaped by waves of immigration since the 17th century. If you'd like, I can provide information about current cultural events or help arrange visits to ethnic neighborhoods.
