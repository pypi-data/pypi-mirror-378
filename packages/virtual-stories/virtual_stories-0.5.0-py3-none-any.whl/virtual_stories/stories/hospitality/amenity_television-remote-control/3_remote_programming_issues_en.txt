Hi, I can't get my TV remote to work properly. The channels aren't programming correctly and some buttons don't respond. Can you fix this?

assistant channel=analysis:
Need to diagnose the remote programming issue and determine the specific problem with channel setup.

{"room_number":"unknown","tv_model":"XR65A80L","issue_description":"channels_not_programming_buttons_unresponsive"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Diagnosis shows programming corruption, will reprogram with cable settings.

{"room_number":"unknown","programming_type":"cable"}

assistant channel=final:
I can help with that. Our technician can reset and reprogram your Sony remote. Could you please provide your room number so we can send someone up?

user:
Sure, I'm in room 2805. I noticed you have a lot of streaming options—does the TV support Apple TV integration?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer about streaming services using system information about built-in apps and features.

assistant channel=final:
For room 2805, our technician will be there shortly to reprogram your remote. Regarding streaming, our Sony TVs have built-in apps for Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, and YouTube TV, but Apple TV integration requires an external device.

user:
Thanks. Speaking of external devices, can I connect my Nintendo Switch to the TV for gaming?

assistant channel=analysis:
System doesn't specify gaming console connectivity details beyond availability; this requires further investigation.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thank you for your gaming question. Checking connectivity options.
