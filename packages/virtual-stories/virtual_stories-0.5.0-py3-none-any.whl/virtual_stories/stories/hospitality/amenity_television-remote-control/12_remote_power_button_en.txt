Hello, I'm staying in room 2205 and the power button on my TV remote isn't working. I can turn the TV on using the button on the TV itself, but the remote power button is completely dead. Any suggestions?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest in room 2205 is experiencing a non-functional power button on their TV remote. I should provide diagnostic steps and alternative solutions based on our LG remote specifications.

assistant channel=final:
I apologize for the inconvenience with your TV remote power button in room 2205. Let's troubleshoot this step by step. First, could you check if the LED indicator light on the remote lights up when you press any button?

user:
No, the LED doesn't light up at all when I press the power button or any other button. It seems completely unresponsive.

assistant channel=analysis:
The remote appears completely unresponsive with no LED indicator. This suggests a battery or internal issue. I can recommend battery replacement and alternative control methods.

assistant channel=final:
Since the remote is completely unresponsive, this is likely a battery issue. Please try replacing both batteries with fresh ones, ensuring correct polarity. As an alternative, you can use our mobile app to control the TV or ask for a replacement remote at the front desk.

user:
I'll try the batteries first. While I'm here, I've been thinking about trying some mountain activities. What's your most popular helicopter tour?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about mountain activities, specifically helicopter tours. This information is available in our system details about helicopter tours over Maroon Bells.

assistant channel=final:
Our most popular helicopter tour is the Maroon Bells Sunrise Experience, featuring breathtaking aerial views of the iconic twin peaks, professional photography, and a champagne breakfast upon return. It lasts about 45 minutes and operates weather permitting.

user:
That sounds incredible! Do you offer any packages that combine helicopter tours with gourmet dining experiences?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is inquiring about packages combining helicopter tours and dining, but our system information doesn't include details about combined packages or special bundled offers.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thank you for your interest in combining our helicopter tours with dining experiences. Researching available package options.
