My TV remote has a stuck power button and some other buttons are acting weird. It's not working properly. Can you fix it?

I can help with that stuck button issue. Our maintenance team can clean and repair it. Could you tell me your room number so someone can come up?

That's great. By the way, do you have noise-canceling headphones available for rent?
