Hi! I saw the glass bottles—where can I refill them?

assistant channel=analysis:
System lists refill stations on L1, L3, and rooftop.

assistant channel=final:
You can refill in the Level 1 lobby by the elevators, at the Level 3 fitness entrance, and up on the rooftop garden next to the herb beds.

user:
Perfect. Does the filtered option on the ice machine use the same system as the refill stations?

assistant channel=analysis:
In‑context: filtered water available on ice dispensers; do not claim the internal system details.

assistant channel=final:
The ice dispensers on Levels 4 and 7 have a filtered water tap, just like the refill points provide filtered water for bottles.

user:
By the way, the rooftop herbs smell amazing.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
They’re fresh‑picked for our kitchen—basil and mint are especially fragrant today.

user:
Could you send me the full filtration brand model and NSF certification numbers?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’m gathering the filtration make, model, and certification details for you.
