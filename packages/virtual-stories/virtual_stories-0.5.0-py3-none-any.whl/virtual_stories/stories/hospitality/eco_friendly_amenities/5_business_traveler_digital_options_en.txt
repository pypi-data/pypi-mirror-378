It truly is spectacular! From your executive suite, you have an unobstructed view of the Bay Bridge and Alcatraz. The fog usually burns off by 10 AM, making it perfect for morning coffee on your private balcony. San Francisco is at its best this time of year.

I can see that. What's the best digital way to explore the city without printed maps?

Great question! Our e-concierge app has built-in GPS navigation with public transit integration. You can also download the SF Muni app for real-time updates. For walking tours, we recommend the "Hidden SF" audio guide—completely digital and narrated by local historians.
