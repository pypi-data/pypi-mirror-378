Wonderful! I've booked three eco-friendly activities for your children. At 10 AM, they'll do a Recycling Art Workshop creating sculptures from recycled materials. The 2 PM Nature Trail Tour explores local wildlife, and the 4 PM Kids Eco Workshop teaches about composting and energy conservation.

That sounds perfect for our nature-loving kids! The mountains here are absolutely gorgeous.

They truly are spectacular! Boulder is surrounded by protected wilderness areas, and from our resort, you can see four different mountain ranges. The Flatirons formation behind us is particularly striking at sunset. It's perfect for teaching kids about geology and local ecosystems.

user:
I'd love to learn more about the geology. Do you have any family-friendly books about that?

Guest asking about educational resources. Provide information about available materials.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! Our Nature Library has several children's books about Colorado geology and wildlife. "Rocky Mountain Rocks" is great for younger kids, and we have activity guides that families can borrow. The library is open 24/7 and has a cozy reading nook overlooking the garden.

user:
Perfect! We'll definitely visit the library. Thank you for arranging such thoughtful activities.
