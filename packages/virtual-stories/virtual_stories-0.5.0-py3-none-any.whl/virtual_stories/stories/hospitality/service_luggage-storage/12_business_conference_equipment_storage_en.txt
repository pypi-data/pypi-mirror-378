Perfect! Could you also help coordinate with IT support to test all my equipment before the presentation?

They want IT support coordination for equipment testing. While we offer equipment testing facilities and technical support liaison as additional services, actual IT support would likely be external coordination beyond our storage services.

Also, can you arrange secure courier delivery of these documents to our Chicago office after the conference?

They want secure courier delivery to their Chicago office, which would be external logistics coordination beyond our storage services, though we might offer corporate coordination for such business needs.
