Is the Winter Market open in the evenings, and can I skate around 18:00?

Check market schedule for evening; confirm rink slot 18:00 and offer rental.

Yes—it's open 11:00 to 21:00, and there’s a skating session at 18:00. It’s an 8‑minute walk from Northwind Plaza; if it’s snowing, the bell desk can loan an umbrella.

Just curious—do you prefer skating before cocoa, or cocoa first for courage?

user:
Skating first! Can you reserve size 8 skates for Emma at 18:00?

{"status":"confirmed","rental_id":"RINK-18-EM-8"}

assistant channel=final:
You’re set: size 8 at 18:00 for Emma (ID RINK-18-EM-8). Rink check‑in is on the south side of Riverbank Square. If you warm up after, our cocoa bar runs until 21:00.
