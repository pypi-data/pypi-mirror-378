Is the rooftop open for fireworks viewing tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide terrace hours, capacity, small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the rooftop terrace is open 19:30–21:30 on a first-come basis. We also run a lemonade stand until 20:30. Tripods are fine if their footprint is under 60 cm. Catching the grand finale or more of a skyline photographer?

user:
Photographer! Can I set up a large tripod and light stand?

assistant channel=analysis:
Tripod size limit; lights not mentioned—keep to stated policy.

assistant channel=final:
Tripods need a footprint under 60 cm; we don’t list lighting rigs for the terrace. You’ll be fine with a compact setup.

user:
Could you provide the exact firing times and barge GPS coordinates?

assistant channel=analysis:
External; use flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] These specifics aren’t covered by our rooftop guidance. Verifying information.
