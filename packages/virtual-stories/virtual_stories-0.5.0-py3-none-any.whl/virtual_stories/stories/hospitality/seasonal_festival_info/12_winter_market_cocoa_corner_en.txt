user:
We’re thinking of visiting the winter market tonight. Any tips and how late your cocoa corner stays open?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide cocoa hours, shuttle limit, walking time; add small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Great plan! Our Cocoa Corner runs 16:00–20:30 with dairy and oat options. The market runs roughly 17:00–21:00 by the Old Wharf—about a 15-minute, well-lit walk back since our shuttle’s last run is 18:30. Want a loaner scarf to keep cozy?

user:
Yes, a scarf would be great. Is the path stroller-friendly?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm path suitability.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the route is curb-cut friendly with smooth paving. If temperatures dip, our lobby has a warm-up area by the fireplace until 22:00.

user:
Can you share vendor booth assignments and real-time crowd levels?

assistant channel=analysis:
Outside scope; escalate.
