It typically runs 19:00–20:00 along the Harbor Promenade. From our lobby, it’s a 12-minute stroll—head east two blocks, then follow the waterfront signs. We’re offering complimentary LED tealights at the front desk and hot tea until 21:30 this week. Sounds like a perfect evening—are you hoping to take photos?

user:
Yes! Could we borrow umbrellas if it drizzles?

assistant channel=analysis:
Umbrella loans available.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—our loaner umbrellas are available at the lobby; just return them after. The promenade surface is smooth and accessible if you’re pushing a stroller.
