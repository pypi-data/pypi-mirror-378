user:
Hi! My partner and I were admiring the skyline—great view. Can we book a shared circuit?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm shared sessions allowed, duration, and bays.

assistant channel=final:
We’re glad you caught the view at sunset. Yes—shared circuit sessions for two are welcome and run 50 minutes including warm‑up. We’ll plan rotations across our three functional bays; Bay 2 has the sled track and Bay 3 offers kettlebells up to 32 kg.

user:
Could we request Bay 2 specifically and play our own playlist over speakers?

assistant channel=analysis:
Bay requests feasible; music volume policy moderate; headphones allowed.

assistant channel=final:
We can prioritize Bay 2 for sled work. For music, the studio keeps a moderate volume for everyone’s comfort—headphones are absolutely fine for personal playlists.

user:
Can you send decibel settings for the speakers and the exact kettlebell inventory by make and year?

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] On it—those equipment specifics are being gathered.
