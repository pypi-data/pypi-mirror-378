assistant channel=final:
Alex is a great fit. He can meet you at 10:30 during a quiet window and use bands, boxes, and benches to tailor low-impact progressions.

user:
Sounds ideal. Will we have enough time to cover warmup and cues?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm 50 minutes sufficient.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—50 minutes is ample for assessment, warmup, and technique work. We can send you summary cues afterward if you like.

That’d be helpful. Thanks.

You’re set for 10:30 with Alex; I’ll note your knee history and follow-up cues.
