Hotel: Meridian Health & Spa Hotel, 640 Grand Park Blvd, Denver, CO.
Facts:
- Sessions are 50 minutes; can design condensed circuits within that time.
- Studio near lobby for quick access; towels and water available.

user:
I only have an hour before checkout—can someone run me through a quick, effective circuit?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm 50-minute session fits; propose lobby-adjacent studio ease.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—a 50-minute circuit fits perfectly, and the studio is right off the lobby for a quick in-and-out. Would starting in 10 minutes work?

user:
That’s great. I’m grabbing a coffee first.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk response.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect—see you in the studio. We’ll keep the transitions tight so you finish on time.
