Hello! I'm visiting from Germany and my hair straightener won't work with your electrical system. I have an important business dinner tonight and really need to style my hair. Can you help?

Guten Tag! No problem at all - I have a dual-voltage straightener that works perfectly with both German 220V and US 110V systems. I'm sending it up now with an international adapter. You'll be styled beautifully for your business dinner!

Wunderbar! That's exactly what I need. I was worried I'd have to go to the dinner with messy hair. Your international services are impressive.

That's very thoughtful planning! I'm curious - do you have German-speaking staff if I need anything else during my stay?
