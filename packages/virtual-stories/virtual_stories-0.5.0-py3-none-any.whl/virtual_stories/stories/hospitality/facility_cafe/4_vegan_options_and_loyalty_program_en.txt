The chia seed pudding sounds perfect! I'm also interested in your loyalty program - how does that work?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is interested in the chia seed pudding and wants to know about our loyalty program. I should explain the loyalty program details and then help them with their order, potentially checking their loyalty status if they provide a guest ID.

assistant channel=final:
Great choice on the chia pudding - it's packed with omega-3s and topped with fresh fruit! Our loyalty program is fantastic: you earn 1 point per $1 spent, with double points on group orders. You can redeem 100 points for $5 off, 200 points for $10 off, or 500 points for $25 off. We also have special benefits like birthday month 50% off and every 10th drink free. Do you have a guest ID so I can check your current points status?

user:
That's exciting! I love how eco-friendly the cafe feels.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is a nice chitchat comment about the eco-friendly atmosphere. I should respond warmly and maybe mention some of our sustainability initiatives that contribute to that feeling.

assistant channel=final:

About 80% of our ingredients are sourced locally within 100 miles, and we're carbon neutral through renewable energy partnerships.

user:
What are the nutritional benefits of the chia pudding specifically?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the nutritional benefits of the chia pudding. This information is available in my system knowledge - I can provide the specific nutritional details about the chia pudding including calories, protein, and omega-3 content.

assistant channel=final:
The Chia Seed Pudding is nutritionally excellent! It's 320 calories with 15g of protein, making it a great plant-based protein source. The chia seeds are particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which support heart and brain health. It's also high in fiber, which helps with digestion and keeps you feeling full. The fresh fruit topping adds natural vitamins and antioxidants. It's a perfect choice for a nutritious, satisfying breakfast or snack.

user:
Do you have any information about the specific farms that supply your chia seeds?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for very specific information about the farms that supply our chia seeds. This detailed supply chain information about individual ingredient suppliers goes beyond what's available in my system knowledge or tools. I should use the ATTENTION flag since this requires information not available to me.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a great question about our ingredient sourcing. Looking up the latest information.
