Excellent! I'll need to be here for about 4 hours. Can I get a large cappuccino to start? Guest ID HY-727.

The workspace setup is really comfortable. Much better than working from my hotel room.

user:
Do you have any private areas or phone booths for sensitive calls?

Guest is asking about private areas for sensitive calls. This information isn't in my system prompt, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

[ATTENTION] That's a great question about private spaces. Let me check what private areas we have available for sensitive calls.
