Hello! Yes, our shuttle is pet-friendly! We welcome dogs and cats with advance notice. We have a specialized pet transportation service with climate-controlled pet sections and secure restraints. There's a $15 fee per pet, and we require 24-hour advance notice for pet reservations.

That's great! What do I need to bring for my dog?

The guest is asking about requirements for bringing their dog on the shuttle, which are mentioned in our pet policy.

You'll need to bring a health certificate, vaccination records, and a pet carrier for your golden retriever. We also provide complimentary pet treats, water bowls, and pet waste bags. We have a pet relief area at our pickup location and a pet-friendly waiting area.

Perfect! What time would you recommend for a 2 PM flight?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for timing recommendations for a 2 PM flight. I need to consider travel time and suggest appropriate departure times.

assistant channel=final:
For a 2 PM flight, I'd recommend departing around 12 PM to allow for the 25-minute journey to Portland International Airport plus check-in time. Our pet-friendly departures run every 90 minutes, so you'll want to book the 12:00 PM departure.

That works perfectly. Do you have any special amenities for pets during the ride?
