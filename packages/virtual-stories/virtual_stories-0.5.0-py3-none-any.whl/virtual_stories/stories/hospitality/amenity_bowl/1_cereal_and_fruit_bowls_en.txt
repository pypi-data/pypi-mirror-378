Hi there—do you have a couple of bowls I could use for cereal and some fruit in room 512?

Yes—both porcelain (16 oz) and bamboo (14 oz) bowls are available right now. Would you prefer porcelain, bamboo, or one of each for room 512?

One porcelain and one bamboo sounds great. If possible, could they be re-sanitized before delivery? Also, the lobby art is cool!

Acknowledge the design compliment with a simple note, then create the delivery request with sanitized=true.
