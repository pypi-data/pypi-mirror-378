Hello—could I get one stainless bowl for my dog to room 702? Also, do you deliver if DND is on?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer DND policy; check room; check stainless stock; deliver.

assistant channel=final:
We don’t deliver when DND is active. I’ll confirm your room status and bowl availability now.

Thanks! The rubber base will be handy.

It helps keep spills down—good for excited pups.

Any dog parks nearby?
