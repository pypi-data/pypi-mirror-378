user:
Hi! I'm in room 512 and I'd like to have some ice cream for dessert. What bowl sizes do you have that would work well for ice cream?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about bowl sizes for ice cream dessert. I should present the options and recommend appropriate sizes for ice cream serving, considering that ice cream is typically served in moderate portions.

assistant channel=final:
Hello! For ice cream dessert, we have three bowl options: porcelain bowls (16 oz), bamboo bowls (14 oz), and stainless steel bowls (18 oz). For ice cream, I'd recommend either the porcelain (16 oz) or bamboo (14 oz) bowls - both are perfect sizes for dessert portions. The bamboo bowls are particularly nice as they stay cool and have a natural feel. Which would you prefer?

user:
The bamboo bowl sounds great! I love that it stays cool. Can you deliver one to room 512?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest has chosen the bamboo bowl and wants it delivered to room 512. I should confirm the delivery and provide timing information.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect choice! The bamboo bowl will stay cool and is ideal for ice cream. I'll arrange delivery to room 512 - it should arrive within 10-15 minutes. The bowl will be sanitized before delivery. Please leave it on the desk when you're finished - we'll collect it during evening turndown.

user:
Excellent! I'm really enjoying the hotel's design - that driftwood coffee table in the lobby is beautiful.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is making small talk about the hotel's design, specifically mentioning the driftwood coffee table which is mentioned in the system prompt. This is a nice chitchat moment.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! The driftwood coffee table is one of our favorite design elements - it adds such a natural, coastal feel to the lobby. I'm glad you're appreciating the design details. Your bamboo bowl should be arriving shortly for your ice cream dessert!

user:
It really does! One quick question - do you know if the hotel offers any special dessert services or late-night treats?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about special dessert services or late-night treats, which goes beyond the system prompt information about standard amenities and services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since I don't have specific information about dessert services or late-night offerings.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about dessert services. Reviewing available resources.

user:
No problem, I'll check with room service. Thanks for your help with the bowl!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is thanking me and ending the conversation. I should provide a friendly closing response.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! Enjoy your ice cream dessert with the beautiful harbor view. Have a wonderful evening!
