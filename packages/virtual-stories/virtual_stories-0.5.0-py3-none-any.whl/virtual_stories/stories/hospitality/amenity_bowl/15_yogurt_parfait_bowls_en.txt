Good morning! I'm in room 512 and I'd like to make a yogurt parfait with layers of fruit and granola. What bowl would work best for layering?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about bowl options for yogurt parfait preparation with layering. I should recommend bowls that would work well for layering and presentation, considering the visual aspect of parfaits.

assistant channel=final:
Good morning! For yogurt parfait layering, I'd recommend either the porcelain bowl (16 oz) or bamboo bowl (14 oz). The porcelain bowl has a nice wide opening that's perfect for layering yogurt, fruit, and granola, and it's microwave-safe if you need to warm any ingredients. The bamboo bowl is also great for parfaits and has a natural, organic feel that complements healthy breakfasts. Which would you prefer?

user:
The porcelain bowl sounds perfect for layering! Can you deliver one to room 512?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest has chosen the porcelain bowl and wants it delivered to room 512. I should confirm the delivery and provide timing information.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice! The porcelain bowl is ideal for parfait layering with its wide opening. I'll arrange delivery to room 512 - it should arrive within 10-15 minutes. The bowl will be sanitized before delivery. Please leave it on the desk when you're finished - we'll collect it during evening turndown.

user:
Perfect! I'm really enjoying my stay here. The harbor view from my room is absolutely stunning, especially in the morning light.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is making small talk about enjoying their stay and the harbor view, which is mentioned in the system prompt. This is a nice chitchat moment that doesn't require any tools.

assistant channel=final:
I'm so glad you're enjoying your stay! Room 512 does have one of our best harbor views with those floor-to-ceiling windows. The morning light reflecting off the water is truly beautiful. Your porcelain bowl should be arriving shortly for your yogurt parfait!

user:
It really is magical! Do you know if the hotel has any special breakfast packages or healthy meal options?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about special breakfast packages or healthy meal options, which goes beyond the system prompt information about standard amenities and services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since I don't have specific information about meal packages or special dietary options.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about breakfast packages. Checking available options.

user:
No worries, I'll check with the restaurant. Thanks for your help with the bowl!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is thanking me and ending the conversation. I should provide a friendly closing response.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! Enjoy your yogurt parfait with the beautiful harbor view. Have a wonderful morning!
