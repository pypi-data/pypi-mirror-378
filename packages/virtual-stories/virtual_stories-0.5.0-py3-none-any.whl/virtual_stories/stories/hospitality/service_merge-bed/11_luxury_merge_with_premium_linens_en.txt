Excellent choice! 2:30 PM is perfect - I'll have our premium team arrive then. The Royal Suite views of the Chao Phraya River are absolutely stunning, aren't they? We'll also apply our signature aromatherapy pillow mist and coordinate with your turndown service. Would you prefer firm, medium, or soft pillows for your king setup?

Medium pillows would be great. Can you also add a heated mattress pad?
