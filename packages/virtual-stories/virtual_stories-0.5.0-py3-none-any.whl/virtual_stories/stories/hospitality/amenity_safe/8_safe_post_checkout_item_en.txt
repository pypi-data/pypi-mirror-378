I checked out of 1603 but left earrings in the safe. Is there any way to check?

We can verify the current safe state only; policy indicates items go to lost-and-found if found by housekeeping. Provide policy-level answer without claiming possession.

Housekeeping resets safes after checkout; if items are found, they’re processed under lost-and-found. The safe in 1603 now shows as reset.
