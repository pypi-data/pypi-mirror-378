Our Spring Garden package ($60-$120) features beautiful tulips, daffodils, cherry blossoms, and local wildflowers in natural, garden-style arrangements. All our flowers are grown within 50 miles of the resort, and we use biodegradable packaging and water-efficient designs. Would you like to see our current spring varieties?

Wonderful! For room 145, I can create a beautiful spring garden arrangement with our current local varieties: vibrant yellow daffodils from Willow Creek Farm, pink cherry blossoms from the resort's own orchard, purple tulips from Green Valley Organic, and delicate white wildflowers from the nearby meadow. The arrangement will have a natural, loose garden style that brings the outdoors inside. Would you like it delivered this afternoon?
