user:
Hello! Quick question—my passport has a handwritten note by the entry stamp. Can someone explain what it means?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use system info: staff languages, immediate help via tele-interpretation; small talk friendly.

assistant channel=final:
Welcome back! We can help explain general annotations. If it’s in Spanish or French, I can take a look with you now; for other languages we can connect you to our tele-interpretation line at 7777 and get an interpreter on in about a minute. Would you like to stop by the desk or use the lobby phone now?

user:
Thanks. Also, can you translate a short 2-sentence courier label into Japanese for my package?

assistant channel=analysis:
Fits the 200-word limit; turnaround 24 hours, rush possible.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—your two sentences fit within our complimentary 200-word limit. If you email a photo or DOCX/PDF, we’ll return it within 24 hours. If you need it sooner, we can check a rush option for a fee. Want me to set that up?

user:
By the way, what a beautiful lobby! The art feels coastal.

assistant channel=analysis:
Add chitchat.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! The pieces are by local artists and change every quarter—we just installed a new series inspired by the harbor’s morning light.

user:
Could you interpret a call with the national immigration hotline to resolve my residency category today, and guarantee a specific agent who handles legal clarifications?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond documented scope (legal guarantees/support). Trigger special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I appreciate the urgency—this is being coordinated for appropriate handling.
