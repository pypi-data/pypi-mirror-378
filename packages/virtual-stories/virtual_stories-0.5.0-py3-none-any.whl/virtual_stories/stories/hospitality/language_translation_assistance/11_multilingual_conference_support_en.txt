Hi there! I’m hosting a quick 12-person investor briefing at 3 PM. Could you help with Mandarin interpretation and translate two door signs?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm room fit, interpreter options, signage translation limits, and connection method.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—our Harbor Boardroom seats 12 and has dual displays plus a polyglot conference phone, so it’s a great fit. For Mandarin, we can either:
- Arrange an in-person interpreter (4-hour minimum; same-day is possible before 14:00 if available), or
- Use our 24/7 tele-interpretation by dialing 7777 from the boardroom phone (usually connects in 45–90 seconds).

For the two door signs, you’re within the complimentary 2-page/200-word limit. If you email PDF/DOCX or clear photos, we’ll return them within 24 hours; rush under 6 hours can be arranged for a fee. Would you prefer in-person or tele-interpretation at 3 PM?

user:
Nice! If we do tele-interpretation, do captions also appear on the screens?

assistant channel=analysis:
Tie to system: captions available EN/ES with in-house laptop.

assistant channel=final:
Real-time captions are available in English and Spanish when we route through our in-house laptop. Mandarin captions aren’t supported on our captioning setup yet, but interpretation audio will still come through the boardroom system clearly.

user:
Got it. Also, could you translate our full 16-page investor deck to Mandarin and localize financial terms by 2 PM?

assistant channel=analysis:
Request exceeds documented scope (2 pages complimentary; 24-hour standard). Trigger special flag with neutral processing message.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Appreciate the detailed request—this is being reviewed for next-step options.
