My laptop isn’t showing—HDMI cable is in. What should I try?

{"steps":["Set projector input to HDMI1","Reseat HDMI at both ends","On laptop: duplicate display (Win+P/Mirroring)","Set resolution to 1920x1080","Power-cycle projector if no signal","Try alternate HDMI port/cable if needed"]}

Try these: set input to HDMI1, reseat HDMI at both ends, duplicate the laptop display, set 1920×1080, then power-cycle the projector if needed; if no image, try the other HDMI port or cable.
