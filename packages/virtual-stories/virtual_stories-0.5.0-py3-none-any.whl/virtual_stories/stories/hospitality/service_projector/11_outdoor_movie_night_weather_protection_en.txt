Can you also provide a projector that automatically adjusts its brightness based on cloud cover and sunset timing to maintain perfect viewing throughout the evening?

assistant channel=analysis:
This request involves automatic brightness adjustment based on weather conditions and real-time environmental monitoring, which would require advanced smart technology and environmental sensors far beyond standard projector capabilities.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Automatic environmental brightness adjustment requires specialized smart technology systems. Investigating available outdoor viewing options.
