Hi! I'm putting together an emergency kit for my family and need some alcohol pads. Can you send 15 to room 1847?

Absolutely! I can send 15 individually wrapped alcohol pads (70% isopropyl alcohol) to room 1847. Our complimentary first-aid delivery typically takes 5-10 minutes for urgent requests. Would you like me to include any other emergency items like bandages, sterile gauze, or antiseptic wipes?
