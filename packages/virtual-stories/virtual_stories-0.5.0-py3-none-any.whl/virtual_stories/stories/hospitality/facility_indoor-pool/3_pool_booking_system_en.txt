Hi there! I'm celebrating my 10th wedding anniversary next week and I'd love to surprise my wife with a romantic dinner by the pool. Is that possible?

The guest wants to book a romantic dinner by the pool for their anniversary. I should check availability first, then get pricing information for the private booking and catering services.

Great! The pool is available for private booking on Valentine's Day. I have pricing information for both the pool booking and catering services. I should present this information in a romantic and special way for their anniversary.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations on your 10th anniversary! What a beautiful way to celebrate. Yes, we absolutely can arrange a romantic dinner by our Aqua Paradise pool. I have excellent news - we have availability on February 14th with time slots from 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM. I'd recommend the 8:00-10:00 PM slot for the perfect romantic atmosphere.

The private pool booking is 5,000 THB per hour with a 2-hour minimum, plus 2,000 THB for our special romantic setup with candles, flowers, and ambient lighting. For dining, we offer romantic dinner menus ranging from 3,000-8,000 THB per person, with wine pairing options and even a private chef service available. Would you like me to check your room number and make the reservation?

user:
That sounds wonderful! I'm in room 1205. Could you book the 8-10 PM slot? And what's included in the romantic setup?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to proceed with the booking and is asking about what's included in the romantic setup. I should make the reservation and then provide details about the romantic setup package.

assistant channel=analysis:
Perfect! The booking has been confirmed. Now I should provide details about the romantic setup package and confirm the next steps.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent! I've confirmed your romantic pool dinner for February 14th from 8:00-10:00 PM. Your booking reference is POOL-2024-0214-001.

Our romantic setup includes: a private cabana with silk drapes, 50 fresh roses arranged around your dining area, floating candles in the pool, soft ambient lighting with our color-changing LED system, a private butler to serve your meal, and a special anniversary dessert with sparklers. We'll also have our underwater music system playing romantic melodies.

The total cost is 12,000 THB with a 6,000 THB deposit required. Would you like me to arrange the menu selection and wine pairing as well?

user:
Perfect! This is going to be amazing. What kind of weather backup do you have in case it rains?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about weather backup plans. I have this information in my system prompt - it mentions "Fully enclosed with retractable roof for all weather conditions". I can provide this information directly.

assistant channel=final:
No need to worry about the weather! Our Aqua Paradise pool area is fully enclosed with a retractable glass roof system, so your romantic dinner will be perfect regardless of weather conditions. If it's a beautiful evening, we can open the roof for a stunning view of the stars. If there's any rain, we simply close the roof and you'll still have the magical pool atmosphere with complete comfort. The romantic ambiance will be just as perfect either way!

user:
That's fantastic! One last question - do you have any recommendations for the menu? My wife loves Thai food but also enjoys international cuisine.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for menu recommendations. This information is not specifically detailed in my system prompt about the catering options. I should use the [ATTENTION] flag since I don't have specific menu details.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'd love to help you with menu recommendations. Let me gather the current menu options for you.
