Can you program the themed high chair to tell interactive fairy tales while my child eats and automatically adjust the story based on how fast or slow they're eating to encourage healthy eating habits?

This request involves programmable interactive storytelling, real-time eating pace monitoring, and behavioral modification programming, which requires advanced AI storytelling technology and behavioral analysis systems far beyond standard furniture capabilities.
