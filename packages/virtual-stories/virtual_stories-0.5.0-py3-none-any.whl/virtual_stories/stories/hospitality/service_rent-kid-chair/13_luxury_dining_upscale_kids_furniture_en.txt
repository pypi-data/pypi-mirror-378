Can you have the high chair automatically adjust its height and angle throughout the meal based on my child's posture and eating patterns while discretely photographing special family moments without anyone noticing?

assistant channel=analysis:
This request involves automatic posture-based adjustment, eating pattern analysis, and discrete photography without consent, which requires advanced biometric monitoring systems, behavioral analysis, and covert photography capabilities far beyond luxury furniture and raises privacy concerns.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Automatic posture adjustment and discrete photography require specialized monitoring systems. Reviewing available luxury family dining services.
