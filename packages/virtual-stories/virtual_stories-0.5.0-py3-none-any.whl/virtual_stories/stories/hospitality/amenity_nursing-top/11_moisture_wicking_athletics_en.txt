Hi there! I'm in room 834 and was hoping to use your gym, but I need a proper nursing top that can handle a workout. Do you have anything athletic?

That sounds perfect! I'd love a medium in charcoal. And honestly, it's been so hard getting back into fitness after having my baby.

I completely understand—getting back into fitness postpartum is challenging for many mothers. I'll send up a medium charcoal athletic nursing top to room 834. It should arrive in about 10 minutes. We also have a personal trainer who specializes in postpartum fitness if you're interested—she's available Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

A postpartum trainer? That would be amazing!

Guest is excited about postpartum trainer. Since our system knowledge includes this service but I don't have tools to schedule appointments, I need to provide the available information about the trainer and suggest she can schedule through our fitness desk.

Her name is Jessica Kim, and she's wonderful with new mothers. She's available from 7 AM to 7 PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. You can schedule a session at our fitness desk on the second floor, or I can connect you with them now if you'd like.
