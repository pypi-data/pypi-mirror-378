Wonderful to meet a fellow eco-conscious guest! Our laundry center is designed with sustainability at its core. We use energy-efficient front-loading washers and heat pump dryers powered by our solar system. All detergents are biodegradable, phosphate-free, and plant-based in refillable containers. Our greywater recycling system and rainwater collection help conserve water, and we offer low-water wash cycles. Everything operates carbon-neutral with biodegradable packaging and compostable laundry bags. We're LEED Platinum and Green Key Eco-Rated certified!

Our eco-friendly laundry demonstrations show how to maximize efficiency while minimizing environmental impact. We also have environmental tours of our recycling center and organic garden.

I love that you're teaching people! What about tracking my environmental impact?

Great question! We have real-time energy usage displays throughout the laundry center so you can see exactly how much energy your cycles use. Our water consumption tracking shows gallons saved with each eco-cycle, and we provide carbon footprint reporting for all laundry activities. You can even participate in our eco-warrior rewards program - the more sustainable your laundry choices, the more points you earn toward green guest recognition and special rewards!

We run sustainable laundry challenges throughout the year with prizes for the most water and energy-efficient practices.
