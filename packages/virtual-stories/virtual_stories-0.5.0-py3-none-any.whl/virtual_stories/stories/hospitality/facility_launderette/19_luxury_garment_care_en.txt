Everything is documented with garment photography and care instruction records. Your pieces are treated with the same security protocols as museum collections.

Excellent! Do you have personal consultation services? I'd like to discuss the specific needs of each piece.

The guest wants personal consultation services. The system mentions private consultation suites, personal garment stylist, and specialist consultation included in services, so I can explain these VIP consultation options.

Of course! We offer private consultation suites where you can meet with our personal garment stylist and couture specialists. Each consultation includes detailed analysis of your pieces, customized care recommendations, and documentation of specific requirements. Our specialists will examine each garment individually and create a personalized care plan. The consultation is included with our premium service, and we can arrange champagne service during your appointment. We also provide detailed care instruction documentation for your records.

We provide white-glove pickup and delivery service directly to your suite. Our VIP concierge team will collect your garments at your preferred time, ensuring each piece is properly documented and secured in our specialized transport cases. We'll coordinate with your schedule and provide real-time updates throughout the process. Delivery is equally meticulous - your garments will be returned perfectly pressed and presented in our luxury packaging.
