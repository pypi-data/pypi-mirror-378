Hi—could I preorder breakfast for 6:45? I’m trying to trick my body clock.

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm window, offer items, note quiet delivery.

We can stage a 06:45 delivery window. To keep it gentle for jet‑lag, many guests choose steel‑cut oats with banana or an egg‑white omelet with spinach. Teas include chamomile, English breakfast, and green. If you’d like a quiet handoff, I can mark “no knock” so we set the tray inside quietly. Standard $4 delivery, 12% service, plus tax.

user:
Let’s do oats with banana, chamomile tea, and gluten-free toast. Please no knock.
