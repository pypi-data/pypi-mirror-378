Hi, is it too late to order something vegan to the room? I'm a bit hungry after my flight.

Welcome to Seabreeze Harbour—late arrivals deserve a good bite. You’re right on time: our late-night vegan menu runs 23:00–06:00. Popular picks: roasted vegetable quinoa bowl, tomato basil soup, avocado hummus flatbread (can be wrapped in lettuce for gluten-free), and a fresh fruit plate. Delivery to Tower A rooms is typically 25–35 minutes. There’s a $4 delivery fee plus 12% service charge and tax. Would you like some still water sent up as well? We also replenish two complimentary glass bottles daily.

user:
That sounds great. I’ll do the quinoa bowl with the soy dressing on the side and the soup. Any chance you can make it extra spicy?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm items, mention allergen board and spice option if within system; provide delivery estimate.

assistant channel=final:
Got it: one roasted vegetable quinoa bowl with soy dressing on the side, and one tomato basil soup. We can add house chili flakes on the side for heat. We’ll prepare on our dedicated vegetable board; however, we’re not a certified nut-free kitchen. To Tower A, expect around 30 minutes this hour.

user:
Thanks! By the way, do you know if my room has a microwave? If not, what’s the reheating guidance?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from system: microwaves on request; provide guidance about no ovens, tray pickup policy.

assistant channel=final:
Guestrooms don’t include ovens, and microwaves are available on request—happy to send one if you’d like. Your soup arrives hot in an insulated cup; for the quinoa bowl, if it cools, reheat in 30‑second bursts and stir between bursts to keep the greens crisp. When you’re finished, place the tray outside and press “Dining 1” or dial 9—overnight collection rounds happen about every 45 minutes.

user:
Perfect. Also, what gate number does my flight to Vancouver depart from tomorrow morning?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; use special flag and end.
