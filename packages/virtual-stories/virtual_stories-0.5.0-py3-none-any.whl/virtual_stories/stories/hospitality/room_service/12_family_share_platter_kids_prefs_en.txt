Hi! We just got the kids settled. Do you have something easy we can all share?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer family platter, mention kids’ options, provide timing, small talk.

Evening and congratulations on bedtime victory—that’s an achievement. Our Family Share Platter is popular at this hour: grilled chicken strips, roasted potatoes, steamed broccoli, and mini rolls with two dips—ranch, honey‑mustard, or marinara. We can also add a simple side salad. From the kids’ menu there’s buttered pasta, cheese quesadilla, and more. If Tower B 12th floor works, delivery is about 25–30 minutes.

user:
Great—platter with marinara and honey-mustard, plus one buttered pasta. Can you split the bill across both connected rooms?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer billing split per system; confirm fees.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely. We can split the check between both room folios if each is authorized. There’s a $4 delivery fee, a 12% service charge, and local taxes. I’ll list the platter and the buttered pasta with the split you prefer—half and half works for many families. Does that sound good?

user:
Yes. Also, where can I refill water and grab ice myself?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from system: ice machines floors 10 and 14; complimentary glass bottles policy.

assistant channel=final:
For self‑serve ice, machines are on floors 10 and 14. Your room includes two complimentary glass water bottles per day; we’re happy to send extra bottles if needed—they’re chargeable after the two.

user:
Thanks! Random question: Can you pull yesterday’s traffic data around the aquarium so we plan tomorrow’s route?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; special flag.

[ATTENTION] Trip planning sounds fun. Checking available options.
