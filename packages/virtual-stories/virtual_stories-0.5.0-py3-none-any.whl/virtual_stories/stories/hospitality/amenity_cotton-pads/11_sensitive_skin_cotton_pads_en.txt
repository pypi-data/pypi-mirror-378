user:
Hi—my skin is very sensitive. Do you have soft, unscented cotton pads you can send up soon?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from system: we have organic, lint-free, sterile options; delivery 15–25 minutes; first 10-count sleeve complimentary.

assistant channel=final:
Yes. We carry 100% organic ultra-soft and lint-free rounds, all unscented and hypoallergenic (EU Ecolabel, OEKO-TEX Class I). I can send a complimentary 10-count sleeve to your room within about 15–25 minutes—would you like Organic Ultra-Soft or Lint-Free Precision?

user:
Organic Ultra-Soft please. Also, how much for a full 80-count box?

assistant channel=analysis:
Pricing is defined in Policies: $9 per 80-count box.

assistant channel=final:
Great choice. An 80-count paper-box is $9. I’ll pair that with your complimentary sleeve unless you prefer only the sleeve.

user:
Thanks! And do you know if there’s a good sushi spot within walking distance?

assistant channel=analysis:
Restaurant tips are outside the system context; use ATTENTION flag with a neutral processing line.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That’s outside the provided details. Checking available options.

user:
No worries. By the way—appreciate the quick help!

assistant channel=analysis:
Simple friendly acknowledgment; small talk is fine.

assistant channel=final:
Happy to help—your amenity will be on its way shortly and handled gently at the door.
