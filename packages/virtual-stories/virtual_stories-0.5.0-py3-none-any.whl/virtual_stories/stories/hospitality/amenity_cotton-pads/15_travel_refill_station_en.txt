Can I get a small refill and a travel pouch for my carry-on?

Offer 20-count sleeve and $4 travel pouch; first 10 ct complimentary—clarify if they want to use the credit.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we can send a 20-count sleeve ($5) and a washable travel pouch ($4). If you’d like, we can apply your complimentary 10-count to reduce the sleeve to effectively 10 additional pads.
