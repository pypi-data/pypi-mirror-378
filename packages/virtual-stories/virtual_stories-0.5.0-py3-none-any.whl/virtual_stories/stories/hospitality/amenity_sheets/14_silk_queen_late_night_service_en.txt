Hi, I need silk queen sheets delivered to room 4521. It's getting late, but I really need them tonight.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest needs silk_1000tc queen sheets for late-night delivery. This is within extended hours (22:00–02:00) but will have extended delivery time and premium service fee.

assistant channel=final:
I'll arrange silk 1000TC queen sheets for room 4521. Since it's late night, delivery will take about 40 minutes due to our extended hours service. There's a premium service fee for late-night delivery, but I'll prioritize your request. The silk sheets are temperature regulating and perfect for Las Vegas nights.

user:
That's fine, I don't mind the fee. What time do you stop delivering?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from system: 06:00–02:00.

assistant channel=final:
We offer same-day sheet changes from 6:00 AM to 2:00 AM, so you're well within our service window. Late-night delivery (10:00 PM to 2:00 AM) includes our premium service fee.

user:
The city lights from up here are amazing!

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk about the city views.

assistant channel=final:
I'm glad you're enjoying the Strip views! Room 4521 has one of our best panoramic views of the Las Vegas skyline. The silk sheets will make your night even more luxurious.

user:
Could you help me find a good late-night restaurant that's still open?

assistant channel=analysis:
Restaurant recommendations are beyond the scope of available tools and not defined in system prompt.
