Hi there! I have reservation CB-55678 and need to check in around 7:00 AM. My flight was delayed 6 hours due to severe weather, and I'm exhausted. Is early check-in possible?

Thank you! How's the weather been here? I hope it's better than where I came from.

Welcome to Canopy Bay! The weather here has been much more pleasant - sunny with just light clouds. You should have a wonderful stay despite the travel delays.

Can you also waive the early check-in fee entirely due to the weather delay being beyond my control?
