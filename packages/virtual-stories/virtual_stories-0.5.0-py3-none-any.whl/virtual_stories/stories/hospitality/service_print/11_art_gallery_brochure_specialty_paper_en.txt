Can you also design the brochures from scratch using AI-generated artwork that matches the exact color palette of the original paintings in my gallery?

assistant channel=analysis:
This request involves custom AI artwork generation and exact color matching to specific paintings, which goes far beyond standard printing services and would require specialized design and AI art generation services not covered in our amenities.

[ATTENTION] AI-generated artwork design services require specialized creative resources beyond standard printing. Exploring available design options.
