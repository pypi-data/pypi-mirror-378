Can you design the invitations to include real pressed flowers from your tropical gardens and have them change color based on the temperature of the person holding them?

assistant channel=analysis:
This request involves incorporating real pressed flowers and temperature-sensitive color-changing materials, which would require specialized botanical preservation techniques and thermochromic printing technologies not available in standard luxury printing services.
