system:
Multiple reminder calls can be scheduled within the same morning. Standard increments allow 1‑minute granularity. Secondary confirmations can follow each primary reminder by 5 minutes if requested. Quiet hours 10:00 PM–7:00 AM permit wake calls.

user:
Morning—your lobby jazz is on point. I need calls at 6:35, 7:10, and 7:45, each with a five‑minute confirmation.

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm minute‑granular scheduling and confirmations.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—we’ll line these up precisely: 6:35 with a 6:40 confirm, 7:10 with a 7:15 confirm, and 7:45 with a 7:50 confirm.

user:
Could you share the uptime SLA of the call platform and last month’s failure‑rate report?

[ATTENTION] Understood—service metrics are being compiled now.
