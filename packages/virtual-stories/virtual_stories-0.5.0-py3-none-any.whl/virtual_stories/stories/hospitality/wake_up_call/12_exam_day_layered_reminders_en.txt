Quiet hours run 10:00 PM–7:00 AM. Wake‑up calls are allowed during quiet hours; courtesy door knocks occur only at the guest’s request. The system supports a primary call plus a secondary call 5–10 minutes later. Notes can be added to the folio regarding exam schedule.

user:
Hello! Big exam tomorrow—can I set 6:00 AM with a 6:07 backup and a gentle knock?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm within quiet hours; set call and knock.

assistant channel=final:
You’ve got this. I’ll schedule a 6:00 AM call, a 6:07 AM backup, and a gentle courtesy knock—quiet‑hour compliant since it’s at your request.

user:
Could you send me the call log export format and retention period?
