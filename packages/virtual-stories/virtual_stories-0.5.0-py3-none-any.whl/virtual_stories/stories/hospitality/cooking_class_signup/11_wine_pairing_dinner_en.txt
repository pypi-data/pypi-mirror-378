Absolutely! We have a romantic couples' cooking class the next day that would pair beautifully with your wine dinner. It's a 2.5-hour hands-on session where you'll learn to prepare a three-course meal using local ingredients, with wine pairings throughout. The class is limited to 8 couples and includes all ingredients, recipes, and a bottle of wine to take home.

Our estate wines are the highlight of the experience! You'll taste through our Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Pinot Noir from our 50-acre vineyard. Each wine is paired specifically with the courses - for example, our crisp Chardonnay with the seasonal vegetable antipasti, and the full-bodied Cabernet with the mushroom risotto. All wines are available for purchase by the bottle or case.

This is perfect! By the way, how do you source your local ingredients?

assistant channel=final:
We source 90% of our ingredients locally! We partner with nearby organic farms, fish sustainably from local waters, and grow herbs and microgreens in our on-site gardens. Our mushrooms come from a specialty farm just 5 miles away, and we work with local artisans for cheeses and breads. This ensures the freshest ingredients and supports our local agricultural community.

user:
That's impressive! What about the wine grapes - do you grow all of them yourselves?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about grape sourcing - this is beyond our standard information. While we grow estate grapes, we don't have detailed information about all grape sourcing for our wine production.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a wonderful question about our viticulture and grape sourcing practices. Reviewing available resources.
