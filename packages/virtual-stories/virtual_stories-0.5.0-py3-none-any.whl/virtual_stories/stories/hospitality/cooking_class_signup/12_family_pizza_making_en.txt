Hi! We have a family of 5 - two adults and three kids aged 8, 10, and 12. We're interested in your pizza-making class. Is it suitable for kids?

Hello! What a wonderful family group! Our pizza-making class is absolutely perfect for kids - we designed it specifically for families with children aged 6 and up. Each child gets their own station with kid-sized tools, and our instructors guide them through making personalized pizzas with their choice of toppings. The adults can enjoy wine tastings in our courtyard while the kids create culinary masterpieces!

The class lasts 90 minutes and starts with a tour of our herb garden where kids pick fresh basil and oregano. Then everyone learns dough stretching techniques, sauce making from scratch, and creative topping combinations. The kids will learn kitchen safety, basic cooking skills, and even get to name their pizza creations! We end with everyone enjoying their pizzas together in the courtyard.
