Hi! I'm a culinary student in Residence Suite 1802. I'm practicing recipes for my internship and need dishwasher pods. Could you send up a few? I'm trying to be efficient with cleanup so I can focus on studying.

Culinary student in Residence Suite 1802 needs dishwasher pods for cooking practice. This matches our student supplies perfectly. I can use the request_student_supplies tool for eco-friendly pods.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_student_supplies:

Absolutely! I've ordered three eco-friendly dishwasher pods for your residence suite. They will arrive in about 15 minutes. As a culinary student, you might also find our study groups and career counseling services helpful for your internship.

user:
That sounds great. I'm juggling classes and cooking practice. By the way, what's the most water-efficient way to run the dishwasher?

assistant channel=analysis:
The student is asking about water-efficient dishwasher usage, which is chitchat/small talk about eco-friendly practices. The system prompt mentions eco-friendly detergent but doesn't provide specific water-saving techniques. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you're interested in water-efficient dishwasher use. Let me find some eco-friendly tips for you.

user:
Actually, let me ask about the study groups. I could use some help with my nutrition coursework. What subjects are covered?

assistant channel=analysis:
The student is asking about study group subjects, which are mentioned in the system prompt. I can provide information about these services without needing tools.

assistant channel=final:
Our study groups cover a wide range of subjects including nutrition, culinary arts, business management, and general education courses. Groups meet regularly and are facilitated by experienced tutors. We also offer one-on-one tutoring sessions upon request.

user:
Excellent! One more question - are there any part-time job opportunities or internships available through the hotel's connections?

assistant channel=analysis:
The student is asking about job opportunities through hotel connections. The system prompt mentions job search resources but doesn't provide specific opportunities or internships. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'd be happy to help you explore job and internship opportunities. Let me check our available resources for you.
