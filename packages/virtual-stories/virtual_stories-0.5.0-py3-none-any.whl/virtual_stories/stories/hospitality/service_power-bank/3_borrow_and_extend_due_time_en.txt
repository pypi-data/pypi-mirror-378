Guest borrows a unit and asks about extending the due time; we record the loan and confirm extension policy with small talk and a flagged out‑of‑scope courier request.

ROLES: user (guest needing extended use), assistant (front desk managing loan and timing)
CHANNELS: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.
