Can you program the power bank to automatically monitor my blood glucose levels and send alerts to my doctor when connected to my insulin pump?

assistant channel=analysis:
This request involves medical monitoring, data transmission to healthcare providers, and integration with medical devices - all of which require specialized medical technology services far beyond power bank capabilities and involve medical privacy regulations.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Medical monitoring and healthcare provider integration require specialized medical technology services. Reviewing available medical resources.
