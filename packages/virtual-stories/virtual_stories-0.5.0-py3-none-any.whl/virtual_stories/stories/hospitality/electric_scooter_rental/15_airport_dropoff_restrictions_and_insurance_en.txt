I have a 7:30 PM flight. Can I ride a scooter straight to the terminal and leave it there?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use airport no-ride zone and permitted drop zones.

assistant channel=final:
The airport grounds are a no-ride zone—scooters auto-stop shortly after entering the ring road. You can ride to Business Park A or Metro Station T3, both just outside the boundary, and park there before continuing to the terminal.

Is the $7 insurance add-on worth it for a quick trip?

Describe coverage and exclusions from system.

assistant channel=final:
The $7/day add-on offsets accidental damage up to $300. It doesn’t apply to incidents from entering no-ride zones or reckless use. For a short ride to the Metro Station T3, many guests skip it, but it’s available if you’d like the added peace of mind.

user:
Your runway views are fantastic—sunset is gorgeous from the lounge.

Small talk acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
Sunsets over the tarmac are special—thank you for enjoying the view with us.

user:
Any update if airport security will allow micromobility drop-offs at the staff gate this weekend?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system context (airport security policy). Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for checking on the staff gate procedure. I'm looking into this.
