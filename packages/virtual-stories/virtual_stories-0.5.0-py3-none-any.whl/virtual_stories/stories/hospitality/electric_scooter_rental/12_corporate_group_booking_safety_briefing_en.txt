Hi! I’m planning a 22-person team ride Friday at 11:00. Can we stage on the South Terrace and do the Waterfront loop?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use group size, time slot, staging and route caps. Mention marshal recommendation.

assistant channel=final:
Friday at 11:00 works well. With 22 riders, we’ll stage on the South Terrace ramp with cones and queue markers. The Waterfront Promenade loop is available and speed-capped at 15 km/h. For safety, we recommend two marshal escorts (one per ~12 riders); we can arrange those for your group size.

user:
Do we need individual waivers or just one for the company?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer with digital waiver policy per rider and ID check.

assistant channel=final:
Each rider 16+ must complete the digital waiver individually, and we’ll verify photo IDs at staging. Once that’s done, we’ll begin the 30–45 minute safety briefing before departure.

Nice. Also, love your lobby coffee—the barista gave me a latte art turtle this morning.

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide small talk acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
That’s wonderful to hear—our baristas enjoy surprising guests with latte art. I’ll pass along the compliment to the morning team.

user:
Last question: can you confirm whether the city is granting temporary exclusive access to the Boardwalk South for corporate groups this Friday?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system context (municipal exclusivity). Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for checking on the exclusivity. Reviewing available resources.
