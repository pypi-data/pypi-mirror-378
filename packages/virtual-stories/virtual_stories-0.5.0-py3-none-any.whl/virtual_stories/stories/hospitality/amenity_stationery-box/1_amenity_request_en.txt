I feel inspired to write a letter. Do you provide any stationery?

The user is asking for stationery. We have stationery boxes as an amenity. I will use the `request_amenity` tool.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "stationery_box", "quantity": 1}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A stationery box is being prepared for you. It will be delivered in 10-15 minutes."}

I'd like to know more about the artists featured in your gallery.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for information about the artists in the gallery. I do not have a tool for this. I will use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

[ATTENTION] I can certainly help with that. Gathering relevant data.
