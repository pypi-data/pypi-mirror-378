What would you recommend for lower-back support for a few hours of laptop work?

assistant channel=analysis:
Recommend Ergo Comfort Plus with memory-foam lumbar cushion and optional footrest.

assistant channel=final:
I recommend the Ergo Comfort Plus paired with a memory-foam lumbar cushion; we can add a compact footrest to keep your hips and knees balanced for laptop work.
