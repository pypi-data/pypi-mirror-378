Do you have something with adjustable lumbar and 4D armrests? I’m on calls all afternoon.

assistant channel=analysis:
Match to SWS-Ergo Pro (lumbar dial, 4D arms). Delivery 15–25 min; fee complimentary for first chair.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the SWS-Ergo Pro has an adjustable lumbar dial and 4D armrests, plus height and multi-tilt. I can deliver and set it up in about 15–25 minutes at no charge for the chair—would you like a footrest or memory-foam cushion as well?

user:
Footrest sounds good. Can you set the seat height for a 74 cm desk?

assistant channel=analysis:
Desk height 72–74 cm; offer setup and quick fit.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely. I’ll bring the footrest and set the SWS-Ergo Pro for a 74 cm desk: seat height just under elbow level, lumbar dial mid setting, and arms parallel to the desktop.

user:
Thanks! Also—do you know a good pizza place nearby?
