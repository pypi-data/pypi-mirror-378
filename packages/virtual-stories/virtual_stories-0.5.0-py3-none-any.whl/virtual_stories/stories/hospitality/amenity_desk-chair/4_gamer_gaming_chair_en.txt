That sounds perfect for my prep sessions. I've been grinding a lot lately. What's the most popular game among guests in the esports lounge?

assistant channel=analysis:
The pro gamer is asking about popular games in the esports lounge, which is chitchat/small talk about gaming preferences. The system prompt mentions esports events and gaming amenities but doesn't provide specific popularity data about games. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:

Cool! One more question - are there any upcoming gaming tournaments I could watch or participate in during my stay?

assistant channel=analysis:
The pro gamer is asking about upcoming gaming tournaments. The system prompt mentions hosting gaming tournaments but doesn't provide specific schedules or details about upcoming events. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.
