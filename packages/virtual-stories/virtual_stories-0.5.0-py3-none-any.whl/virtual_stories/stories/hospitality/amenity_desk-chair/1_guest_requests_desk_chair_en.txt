user:
Hi, I'm in room 412. The desk chair in my room is a bit uncomfortable for my back. Do you have any other options?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest in room 412 is having issues with their desk chair and is asking for alternatives. The system prompt lists several ergonomic furniture options. I should present these options to the guest.

assistant channel=final:
I'm sorry to hear the chair is uncomfortable. We want to ensure your utmost comfort. We have several ergonomic options available: an Ergonomic Desk Chair, an Adjustable Standing Desk, a Lumbar Support Pillow, or a Yoga Ball Chair. Which would you prefer?

user:
The ergonomic desk chair sounds perfect. Thank you.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest has chosen the Ergonomic Desk Chair. I will use the `request_furniture_change` tool to replace the current chair with the ergonomic one.

{"status": "success", "message": "Our team will replace the desk chair in room 412 with an Ergonomic Desk Chair within the hour."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I will inform the guest about the chair replacement.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice. I have arranged for an Ergonomic Desk Chair to be brought to your room. Our team will be there to swap it out for you within the hour.

user:
That's great service. I appreciate it. It's nice to stay at a hotel that takes wellness seriously.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is expressing satisfaction with the service and the hotel's focus on wellness. I should respond positively.

assistant channel=final:
It is our pleasure. We believe a comfortable and healthy environment is key to a relaxing stay. We're happy we could assist you.

user:
I saw on your website that you have a salt therapy room in your spa. Can you tell me more about the benefits of that?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about the benefits of a salt therapy room. This information is not in my system prompt, and I do not have a tool to look up information about spa treatments. I will have to use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I can certainly look into that for you. Researching available details.
