Hi there! We have two young children and getting everyone ready by 11 AM is going to be challenging. Could we extend our check-out until 2 PM? Our reservation ID is FAM87654.

assistant channel=analysis:
Family with children needs more time for check-out. I should check if family late check-out is available for their situation.

Yes, it's been fantastic. Could you also recommend a good place for lunch near here? Something quick and kid-friendly?

Family is asking for lunch recommendations. I can provide this information based on hotel knowledge.

I'd recommend the Rainforest Cafe right across from our resort—it's themed like a jungle adventure and the kids love the animatronic animals! They have great burgers, pizza, and salads for the adults. Everything is ready quickly and the atmosphere is fun for the whole family.
