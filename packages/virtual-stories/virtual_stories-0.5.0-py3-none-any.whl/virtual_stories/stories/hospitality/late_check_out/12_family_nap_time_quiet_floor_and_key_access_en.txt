Our toddler naps 11:30–13:00. Could we extend to 13:15 on a quiet floor?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use courtesy/extension policy and quiet floors; keys.

assistant channel=final:
We’ll request a 13:15 extension and aim to keep you on a quiet floor (levels 9 or 10). If approved, we’ll extend your keys digitally so you don’t need to stop by the desk.

user:
Do you have white‑noise machines?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer crib/white‑noise from system.

assistant channel=final:
Yes, we can send a white‑noise machine, and a crib if needed.

The maple scent in the lobby is pleasant.

Is the childcare expo across the street arranging a coordinated late check‑out waiver today?

[ATTENTION] Thanks for raising that coordination question. Checking available options.
