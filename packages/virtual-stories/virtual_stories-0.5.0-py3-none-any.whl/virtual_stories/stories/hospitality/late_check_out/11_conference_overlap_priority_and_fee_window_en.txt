user:
My keynote ends at 12:30—can I keep the room until 13:30?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use fee window and priorities.

assistant channel=final:
We can request a 13:30 departure under the half‑day fee window (12:00–14:00). Because today is a peak conference departure, availability is tighter, but I can prioritize your request and confirm once housekeeping updates are available.

user:
Is luggage hold available if I do need to vacate at noon?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide luggage hold policy.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—luggage hold is complimentary until 22:00 today. We’ll tag your bags so you can head to the keynote unencumbered.

user:
The harbor breeze in your lobby is refreshing.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
We’re glad it adds to the conference energy.

user:
Do you know if the conference organizers arranged a blanket late check‑out past 14:00 with the city’s hospitality bureau?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system context (external arrangement). Special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for checking on the blanket extension. Reviewing available resources.
