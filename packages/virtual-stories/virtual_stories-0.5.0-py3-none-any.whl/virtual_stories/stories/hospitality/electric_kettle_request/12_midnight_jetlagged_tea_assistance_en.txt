Hi, sorry to ping so late—still on Tokyo time. Any chance I can get a kettle now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Deliveries end 23:00 per system; acknowledge and propose first-slot delivery with water bottles.

assistant channel=final:
Welcome and no worries—jet lag is real. Our delivery hours are 7:00–23:00, so I can place a request now for the first 7:00 AM drop. Would you like the stainless steel 1.0 L or the gooseneck 0.8 L? I can also send two complimentary 500 ml water bottles.

user:
Let’s do the gooseneck, please. Does it have auto shutoff?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm safety features per system.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the 0.8 L gooseneck has auto shutoff and is 120V. We’ll queue it for 7:00 AM with two water bottles.

user:
Could you tell me the average electrical load in amps for that specific model?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system context; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That’s a great technical question. I don’t have the model’s exact amperage on hand right now. I’m looking into this for you.
