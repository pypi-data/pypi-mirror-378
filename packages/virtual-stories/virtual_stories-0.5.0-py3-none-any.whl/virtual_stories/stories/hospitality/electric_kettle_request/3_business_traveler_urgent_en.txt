The electric kettle is on its way and should arrive in about 5 minutes. If you need it sooner, our business center on the 2nd floor has hot water available 24/7. How's the weather treating you today?

It's a typical NYC gray day, but that's fine. Thanks for the quick response - this meeting is important.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge the weather comment and business importance. Keep conversation professional and supportive.

assistant channel=final:
I understand completely. Gray days in Manhattan can be quite productive for business. Your kettle should be there momentarily. Would you like me to have the business center prepare any additional materials?

No, the kettle should be sufficient. Thank you.
