Hi! Could I swap these damp towels for fresh ones here, or do I need to go back to the main pavilion?

assistant channel=analysis:
Satellite stand allows exchanges; respond with logistics.

assistant channel=final:
You can exchange them right here at the Quiet Pool stand—we restock every hour. If you prefer, the main Pavilion also handles exchanges until 19:30. Used towels can go in the bin behind the planters just to your left.

user:
Perfect, thanks. Are there any quiet hours I should know about? I’m finishing a novel and don’t want to bother anyone.

From 09:00 to 20:00 this pool observes quiet etiquette—low voices, no speakerphone, and no ball play. If you need a loaner pair of reading glasses, I have +1.0 to +2.5 here at the desk.
