Hi there—could someone help open a few bottles in Magnolia Hall around 7:15 PM?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check assisted opening hours and gala hall note; confirm 19:15 within 18:00–22:30 and within 09:30–22:30 window; provide ETA guidance.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—assisted opening runs 09:30–22:30, and tonight’s Magnolia Hall service window is 18:00–22:30, so 7:15 PM works. A wine service concierge can arrive in about 5–10 minutes to the mezzanine/ballroom levels. Would you like us to bring a twin‑blade opener as well as a standard corkscrew?

user:
Yes, please bring both. Also, your lobby smells amazing tonight.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge small talk; reconfirm tool list.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—we’re glad you noticed. I’ll prepare a standard waiter’s corkscrew and a twin‑blade opener for Magnolia Hall at 7:15 PM.

user:
Can you decant our vintage Champagne too?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check policy: decanting only for still wines; for sparkling, safety stopper only.

assistant channel=final:
For sparkling, we don’t decant; we use a towel‑wrap at 45° for opening and provide a Champagne stopper. Decanting is available for still wines only.

user:
By the way, do you sell any bottles from your cellar to guests?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope—no sales info provided in system. Use ATTENTION.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about cellar sales. Reviewing available resources.
