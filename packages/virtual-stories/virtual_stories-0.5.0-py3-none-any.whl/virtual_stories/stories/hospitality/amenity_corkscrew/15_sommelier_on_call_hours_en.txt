Hi—if I stop by at 10:15 PM, can someone help open a bottle?

assistant channel=analysis:
22:15 is after 22:00; no assisted opening; offer tool loan until 23:00.

assistant channel=final:
Assisted opening runs until 22:00, so at 10:15 PM we can loan a corkscrew at the front desk instead. Tool loans are available until 23:00 for a 120‑minute window.

user:
Got it. The lounge view is stunning tonight!

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Agreed—the skyline reflections are especially vivid this evening.

user:
Do you have electric openers?

We don’t stock electric openers; we offer a standard waiter’s corkscrew and a twin‑blade.
