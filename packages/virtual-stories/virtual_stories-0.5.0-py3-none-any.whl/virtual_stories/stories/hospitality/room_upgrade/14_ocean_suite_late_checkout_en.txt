Hi! The lobby aquarium is mesmerizing—those tiny dartfish are adorable. Is there any chance for an ocean suite and a slightly later checkout?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; outline OJS/OPS prices; mention 10:00/14:00 review, late checkout 13:00 included.

assistant channel=final:
They’re captivating to watch. We check upgrades at 10:00 and 14:00. Ocean Junior Suite is +$70/night and Ocean Panorama Suite is +$130/night. Suite upgrades include a 13:00 checkout; later than that depends on availability and may carry a fee.

user:
Does priority change if a current suite guest wants to extend?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain precedence at 12:00 review.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—at our midday review, existing suite guests requesting to extend get priority on suite inventory.

user:
Could you block the top-floor OPS for me now even if it’s not showing?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; end with flag.
