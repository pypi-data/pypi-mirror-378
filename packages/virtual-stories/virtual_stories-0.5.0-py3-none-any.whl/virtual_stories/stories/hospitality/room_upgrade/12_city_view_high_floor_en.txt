user:
Morning! The espresso at the lobby bar is excellent. Any chance for a high-floor city view?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; specify review time 09:30, tiers, FCV +$35, and high floors 18–25.

assistant channel=final:
Glad you liked it—our barista does a great ristretto. We reassess upgrades at 09:30 once early departures post. Full City View is +$35/night when available, and high floors are 18 to 25. I can hold your request in the queue until 13:00 while we see what opens up.

user:
If I don’t get it by 13:00, what happens?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain release policy.

assistant channel=final:
At 13:00, we release held inventory back to general availability. If something opens later, we can revisit, but it’s less likely.

user:
Could you run a manual override on a currently occupied FCV room and move them?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; close with flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] This request goes beyond the available options here. Reviewing available resources.
