Hi—your signage is super clear, thanks for that. I’ve somehow misplaced both my conference badge and my room key.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, provide reissue and key steps.

assistant channel=final:
I’m glad the signs helped. We can reprint your badge at Desk C in Event Ops—first reissue is free with a photo ID. For your room key, we’ll deactivate the old one and make a new key at Encoder Station A or B once we verify your ID.

user:
Is there a separate L&F for the exhibition hall?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm L&F for event areas and tag format EM-LNF-YYYY-####.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—items from event spaces are tagged EM-LNF-YYYY-#### and kept in the Event Ops safe. We can check today’s intake and contact you if there’s a match.

user:
Could you also push a global deactivation for my badge across all partner venues right now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; end with special flag.
