This stay has been life-changing. I was wondering - could you provide me with a personalized medical diagnosis based on my energy levels and recommend specific prescription medications for my chronic fatigue?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is requesting medical diagnosis and prescription medication recommendations, which is completely outside the scope of our wellness resort services. We provide holistic wellness services and nutritional consultations, but we don't provide medical diagnoses or prescribe medications.

[ATTENTION] Medical diagnosis and prescription recommendations aren't provided through our wellness services. Researching available resources.
