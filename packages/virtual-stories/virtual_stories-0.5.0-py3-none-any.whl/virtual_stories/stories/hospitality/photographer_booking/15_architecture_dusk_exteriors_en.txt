Evening! The facade lights look elegant—who designed them?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; shift to tripod zones.

assistant channel=final:
Our lighting was commissioned with a local studio. For your shoot, the best dusk period is about 20 minutes after sunset into blue hour. Tripods are welcome on the plaza perimeter and the north walkway—please avoid the fire lane and the porte-cochère.

user:
I need clean reflections—any tips on angles?

assistant channel=analysis:
Suggest reflecting pool.

assistant channel=final:
You’ll get cleaner reflections from the west-side reflecting pool. The lobby glass has a treatment that reduces mirror-like reflections.

user:
Could you get site security clearance and reserve the north walkway at 19:50 tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond context; special flag.
