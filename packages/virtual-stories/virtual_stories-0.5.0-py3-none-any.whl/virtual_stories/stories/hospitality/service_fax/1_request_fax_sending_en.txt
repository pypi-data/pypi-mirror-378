Hi, I need to fax 7 pages to +1-617-555-0199 with a short cover note. Can you do that now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm pages within limit, destination is domestic (+1), then submit fax and include page-based charges per policy.

{"room_number":"1823","recipient_number":"+1-617-555-0199","pages":7,"cover_note":"Regarding Q3 contract addendum","destination_type":"domestic"}

{"job_id":"fax_2025_08_29_001","status":"queued","billed_pages":7,"rate_per_page":2,"currency":"USD"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Compute cost 7 x $2 = $14, confirm job id and where handled.

assistant channel=final:
All set—your 7-page domestic fax has been queued (job "fax_2025_08_29_001"). It will be sent via our Level 2 Business Center and billed to room 1823 at $14 USD; the cover page is complimentary and excluded from billing. A transmission receipt can be added to your folio once complete.

user:
Thanks! By the way, that lobby art is striking—who’s the artist?

assistant channel=final:
The Business Center is on Level 2 just past the lobby if you’d like to pass by between transmissions.

user:
Can you tell me the exact artist’s name and their gallery representation?
