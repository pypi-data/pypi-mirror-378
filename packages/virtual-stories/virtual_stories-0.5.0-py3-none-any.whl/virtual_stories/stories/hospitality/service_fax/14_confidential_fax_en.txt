Hello, I need to send a very confidential business document via fax. Can you ensure complete privacy?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest needs confidential fax service. I should provide detailed information about privacy and security measures from system prompt to reassure them about confidentiality.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely, confidentiality is our specialty! We have encrypted fax transmission with 256-bit encryption, private processing areas with soundproof booths, and all staff undergo background checks with signed non-disclosure agreements. Your documents are never left unattended and are immediately shredded after transmission.

user:
That sounds perfect. What about the transmission itself?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about fax transmission security which is detailed in the system prompt as encrypted with verification process.

assistant channel=final:
Our fax transmissions use 256-bit encryption and require recipient confirmation before sending. We use dedicated secure lines for sensitive documents, and you can request verification of successful delivery. All transmissions are logged only for your reference, not stored permanently.

user:
And what happens to my original documents?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about document handling which is specified in the system prompt as immediate return with no storage.

assistant channel=final:
Your original documents are returned to you immediately after transmission - we never store or keep copies. If requested, we can shred them on-site in your presence using our secure document destruction service. This ensures complete confidentiality throughout the entire process.

user:
Excellent. How much does this confidential service cost?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about confidential fax service costs, but the system prompt doesn't specify special pricing for confidential service - only general fax information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Pricing details for specialized confidential services require checking our current secure communications packages. Reviewing options for you.
