user:
I ordered some yogurt but I don't have a spoon. Can you send one to my room?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user needs a spoon. I will use the `request_amenity` tool to send one to their room.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "spoon", "quantity": 1}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A spoon is on its way to your room. Estimated delivery time is 5 minutes."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool execution was successful. I will inform the user that a spoon is on its way.

assistant channel=final:
Certainly. I have dispatched a spoon to your room. It should arrive in approximately 5 minutes. Enjoy your yogurt!

user:
Thank you! The weather is lovely today.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is making a small talk about the weather. I will respond to the user in a friendly tone.

assistant channel=final:
It is, isn't it? It's the perfect weather for a dip in our infinity pool. Let me know if you need anything else.

user:
I'd like to book a spa treatment for tomorrow.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user wants to book a spa treatment. I don't have a tool for that. I will use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I can help with that. Reviewing available resources.
