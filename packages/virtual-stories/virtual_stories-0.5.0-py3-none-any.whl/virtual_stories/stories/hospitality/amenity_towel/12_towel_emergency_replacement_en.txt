I love the aromatherapy in the spa area.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is small talk about the spa aromatherapy service, which I can acknowledge based on the system information about lavender and eucalyptus aromatherapy towel service.

assistant channel=final:
The lavender and eucalyptus aromatherapy in our spa creates such a relaxing atmosphere!

user:
Could you install a towel warmer in my bathroom for the rest of my stay?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about installing equipment, which goes beyond our standard towel service. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since equipment installation isn't covered in our system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you'd like a towel warmer installed. Checking available options.
