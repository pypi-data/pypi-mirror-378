Do you sell metro cards at the front desk?

Use tool for sales availability and nearest purchase point; keep to facts.

State that we don’t sell them and provide the alternative.

We don’t sell metro cards at reception. You can buy them at the 34th St Station vending machines, open 24/7. We can also point out the metro map on the back of our city map.

user:
Got it—thanks.

assistant channel=analysis:
Brief close.

Anytime.
