assistant channel=analysis:
Diagnosis shows power/circuit issue. Since it's urgent with medications inside, I should schedule immediate technician visit while trying basic troubleshooting first.

assistant channel=final:
I understand this is urgent, especially with your medications inside. Our diagnostic shows this could be a power or circuit issue. Please try checking if the safe is properly plugged in and if there's a power outlet reset button nearby. While you do that, I'll arrange for our technician to come immediately.

user:
I checked the outlet and tried resetting it, but the display is still blank. My room is 1208. How soon can someone come?

assistant channel=analysis:
Basic troubleshooting didn't work. I need to schedule urgent technician visit since the guest has medications that need immediate access.

user:
Thank you, that's a relief. I've been traveling with these medications and was worried about the timing. The view from this room is incredible - you can see the entire bay from up here!

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is making small talk about the view while waiting. This doesn't require tool usage - I can respond conversationally using hotel knowledge about the room views.

assistant channel=final:
I'm glad you're reassured - Alex is one of our best technicians. Yes, the rooms on the 12th floor have spectacular views of San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many guests tell us it's the highlight of their stay. The city lights at night are particularly beautiful from that vantage point.

user:
That's what I thought! I'll definitely take some photos later. Thanks again for the quick response - I really appreciate the service here at The Ritz.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is appreciative and concluding the conversation. I should respond warmly and confirm the technician will arrive soon.
