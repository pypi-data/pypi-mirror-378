Hi! I'm a travel blogger and I'd love to take some photos in your outdoor plaza. What are your photography policies?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about photography policies for the outdoor plaza. I should use the photography policies tool to get detailed information about different types of photography permissions.

assistant channel=analysis:
I have comprehensive information about photography policies. The guest is a travel blogger, which would likely be considered commercial use requiring a permit. I should provide detailed information about the policies and requirements.

assistant channel=final:
Great question! For personal photography, you're welcome to take photos without any restrictions. However, since you mentioned you're a travel blogger, that would be considered commercial photography, which requires a permit and advance approval. We encourage social media sharing with our hashtags #GrandVistaHotel and #CedarPlaza, and we appreciate when guests tag our hotel accounts. The plaza has some beautiful photo locations including the shade sail areas, planters with integrated seating, decorative stone inlays, and the string lights in the evening. The LED pathway lighting and decorative string lights provide great lighting, and natural lighting is optimal from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. We do ask that you respect other guests' privacy and don't block pathways with equipment.

user:
I see! What's the process for getting a commercial photography permit?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the process for getting a commercial photography permit. This information is not provided in the system prompt or available through our tools, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'm looking into this for you.

user:
Thanks! What about the lighting? I heard you have some beautiful string lights in the evening.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the evening lighting for photography. This information is available in the system prompt - there are decorative string lights and LED pathway lighting.

assistant channel=final:
Yes! The evening lighting is absolutely beautiful for photography. We have decorative string lights that create a lovely ambiance, plus LED pathway lighting with 3000K warm white bulbs that provide excellent illumination. The combination creates a magical atmosphere that's perfect for photos. The string lights are particularly photogenic and create beautiful bokeh effects in the background. Many guests love taking photos during the golden hour and into the evening when the lights are on. The plaza is open until 11:00 PM, so you have plenty of time to capture the evening lighting.

user:
That sounds perfect! What about the best times to take photos? Are there certain hours when it's less crowded?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the best times for photography when it's less crowded. This information is available in the system prompt - the plaza operates 06:00-23:00 daily, and there are maintenance hours mentioned.

assistant channel=final:
Great question! The plaza is open from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM daily. Early morning (6:00 AM to 8:00 AM) is typically very quiet and peaceful, with beautiful natural lighting. Late evening (after 9:00 PM) is also usually less crowded and perfect for capturing the string lights. The plaza is cleaned daily from 5:00 AM to 6:00 AM, so right after 6:00 AM is ideal for clean, empty shots. Natural lighting is optimal from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, but that's also when the plaza tends to be busier with guests. If you're looking for fewer people in your photos, early morning or late evening would be your best bet.

user:
Perfect! What about social media? I'd love to share my photos on Instagram and tag the hotel.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about social media sharing and tagging. This information is available in the system prompt - social media is encouraged with specific hashtags and hotel account tagging.

assistant channel=final:
We absolutely encourage social media sharing! Please use our hashtags #GrandVistaHotel and #CedarPlaza when you post your photos. We'd also love it if you tag our hotel accounts - it helps other travelers discover our beautiful plaza. Social media sharing is actually encouraged and helps showcase the plaza to potential guests. Just remember that if you're using the photos for commercial purposes (like your travel blog), you'll still need that permit we discussed earlier. But for personal social media posts, feel free to share away!

user:
Excellent! I'll make sure to use those hashtags and tag the hotel. This plaza sounds like a photographer's dream!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is expressing enthusiasm and satisfaction with the photography information. This is a positive response that doesn't require any tools or additional information.

assistant channel=final:
It really is! Cedar Plaza is such a photogenic space with its combination of natural elements, beautiful lighting, and thoughtful design. The decorative stone inlays, planters with integrated seating, and string lights create so many interesting photo opportunities. We're thrilled that you're excited to capture and share the beauty of our plaza. I'm sure your travel blog readers will love seeing it, and we appreciate you helping to showcase our space to the world!
