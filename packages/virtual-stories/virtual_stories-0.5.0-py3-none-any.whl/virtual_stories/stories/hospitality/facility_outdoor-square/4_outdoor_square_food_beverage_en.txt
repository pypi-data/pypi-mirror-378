Good morning! I'm planning a small outdoor lunch gathering in your plaza next weekend. What food and beverage options are available there?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about food and beverage options for the outdoor plaza. I should use the food beverage options tool to get detailed information about available services.

assistant channel=analysis:
I have comprehensive information about food and beverage options. The plaza has a coffee cart, seasonal food trucks, catering services, and proper amenities for food service. I should provide a detailed response about all available options.

assistant channel=final:
Great choice for an outdoor lunch! Cedar Plaza offers several food and beverage options. We have an artisan coffee cart that operates daily from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM with specialty drinks and pastries. On weekends, we host seasonal food trucks from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM with rotating cuisines - perfect for your lunch gathering! We also offer full catering setup with advance notice, including tables, linens, and service equipment. For beverages, we have 2 water fountains (one wheelchair-accessible), and seasonal beverage vendors offer fresh juices, smoothies, and non-alcoholic drinks. The plaza has 4 waste receptacles and 2 recycling stations for easy cleanup, plus multiple power outlets for vendor equipment.

user:
That sounds perfect! What about bringing our own food? Are there any restrictions?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about bringing outside food. This information is in the system prompt - outside food is allowed, but there are some policies about alcohol and vendor permits.

assistant channel=final:
You're welcome to bring your own food! We allow outside food in the plaza, which gives you flexibility for your gathering. Just keep in mind that we don't allow alcohol consumption in the plaza, and if you're planning to sell food commercially, you'll need vendor permits. The plaza has plenty of seating with 24 moveable chairs and 6 planters with integrated seating, so you can set up your lunch however you'd like. We also have 4 waste receptacles and 2 recycling stations to help with cleanup afterward.

user:
Excellent! What about the coffee cart - can I order from them for my event?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about ordering from the coffee cart for their event. The coffee cart operates 08:00-11:00 daily, but the guest is planning a weekend lunch event. I should clarify the timing and suggest alternatives.

assistant channel=final:
The coffee cart operates daily from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM, so it would be perfect if you're planning a morning or brunch gathering! For a lunch event, you might want to consider the weekend food trucks that operate from 12:00 PM to 6:00 PM, or you could bring your own food. The coffee cart specializes in artisan drinks and pastries, so if you're interested in coffee service for your event, you might want to coordinate with our catering team who can arrange coffee service for larger gatherings.

user:
That's helpful! What about the food trucks - how do I know what will be available next weekend?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about specific food truck schedules for next weekend. This information is not provided in the system prompt or available through our tools, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'm looking into this for you.

user:
Thanks! One more question - are there any tables available for setting up food?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about tables for food setup. This information is available in the system prompt - catering setup includes tables, and there are power outlets for vendors.

assistant channel=final:
Yes! When you use our catering service, we provide tables, linens, and service equipment as part of the setup. The plaza also has multiple power outlets available for vendor equipment and catering setup. If you're bringing your own food, you might want to consider our catering service for the table setup, or you can use the moveable chairs and planters with integrated seating that are already in the plaza. The space is quite flexible and can accommodate different setup styles depending on your needs.

user:
Perfect! I think I'll go with the catering service for the tables and bring some additional food. This sounds like it will be a great event!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is expressing satisfaction and seems to have made a decision. This is a positive response that doesn't require any tools or additional information.

assistant channel=final:
That sounds like a wonderful plan! The combination of our catering service for tables and your additional food will give you the best of both worlds. Cedar Plaza is such a lovely space for gatherings, and with the moveable seating and flexible setup, you'll be able to create exactly the atmosphere you want for your lunch event. I'm sure your guests will love it!
