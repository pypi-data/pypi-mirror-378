Absolutely! Cedar Plaza is very animal-friendly, and service animals are welcome without any restrictions. Your service dog will have full access to all areas of the plaza. We have multiple pet waste stations with bags and disposal, and our water fountains are suitable for pets at a comfortable height. The plaza has retractable shade sails and planters that provide shade for animal comfort, and the non-slip concrete surface is safe for paws with no toxic materials. We maintain emergency access for all guests, and there are no toxic plants in the area. The 2,400 square feet of space gives plenty of room for your service dog to move around comfortably.

That's wonderful! What about regular pets? I have a friend visiting who might bring their dog.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about regular pets (not service animals). This information is available in the system prompt - pets are allowed on leash with certain requirements.

assistant channel=final:
Regular pets are welcome too! They need to be on a leash and well-behaved, and we ask that owners clean up after them using our pet waste stations. The same animal-friendly amenities apply - water fountains suitable for pets, shaded areas for comfort, and the safe non-slip surface. We just ask that pet owners respect other guests' comfort and maintain control of their animals. The plaza is spacious enough that well-behaved pets can enjoy the space without disturbing other guests.

user:
Perfect! What about the water fountains? Are they safe for dogs to drink from?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about water fountain safety for dogs. This information is available in the system prompt - the water fountains are suitable for pets and at a pet-friendly height.

assistant channel=final:
Yes, the water fountains are designed to be pet-friendly! They're at a comfortable height for dogs to drink from, and the water is safe for pets. We have 2 water fountains in the plaza, and one is specifically designed to be wheelchair-accessible, which also makes it easier for pets to reach. The water quality is the same as what we provide for human guests, so it's perfectly safe for your service dog or any visiting pets.

user:
That's great! What about the surface? I want to make sure it's comfortable for my dog's paws.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the surface comfort for their dog's paws. This information is available in the system prompt - the surface is non-slip concrete with decorative stone inlays and is safe for paws.

assistant channel=final:
The surface is very comfortable for dogs! It's non-slip concrete with decorative stone inlays, which provides good traction and is gentle on paws. The surface is designed to be safe and comfortable for all guests, including our four-legged friends. There are no sharp edges or toxic materials, and the drainage system with a 2% slope ensures the surface stays dry and comfortable. Your service dog should be very comfortable walking and resting on the plaza surface.

user:
Excellent! What about the shade? My dog gets hot easily in the sun.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about shade for their dog. This information is available in the system prompt - there are retractable shade sails and planters that provide shade.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! The plaza has excellent shade options for your dog. We have retractable shade sails that are deployed from May through September, providing plenty of coverage from the sun. There are also 6 planters with integrated seating that create natural shaded areas. The combination of shade sails and planters ensures there are always cool, shaded spots available throughout the day. During the summer months, we also have a misting system that can help keep the area cool and comfortable for both you and your service dog.

user:
That sounds perfect! What about the maintenance schedule? I want to make sure the area is clean for my dog.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the maintenance schedule to ensure cleanliness for their dog. This information is available in the system prompt - there are daily and weekly cleaning schedules.

assistant channel=final:
The plaza is kept very clean! We have daily cleaning from 5:00 AM to 6:00 AM, which includes surface cleaning, waste disposal, and furniture arrangement. Every Sunday from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM, we do a deep cleaning with power washing and equipment inspection. We also have 4 waste receptacles and 2 recycling stations, plus the pet waste stations, so the area stays clean throughout the day. The maintenance team is very thorough about keeping the plaza clean and safe for all guests, including pets.

That's reassuring! I'm so glad the plaza is so pet-friendly. My service dog will love it there.
