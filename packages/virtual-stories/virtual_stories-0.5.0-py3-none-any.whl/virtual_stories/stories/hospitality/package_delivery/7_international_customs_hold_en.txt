Hi, I’m expecting a box from London for Mei Lin. If customs holds it, could you note my UK sender’s contact so they can reach me?

Check arrival; then add a delivery note.

Thanks, Mei. I don’t see it checked in yet. I’ve added the sender’s UK number so we can coordinate if customs calls. We’ll notify you as soon as it scans in—and if you’re around later, tea is served in the lobby from 4 to 5:30.
