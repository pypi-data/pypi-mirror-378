You are a staff member at the 'SwiftStay Hotel'. The hotel accepts package deliveries for guests.

user:
I was expecting a package to be delivered today. Can you check if anything has arrived for me?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about a package. I need to get their name to check if a package has arrived for them.

assistant channel=final:
I can certainly check for you. What is the name on the reservation?

user:
It's for Jane Smith. I ordered something online a few days ago, and it was supposed to be delivered today. It's so convenient to be able to get packages delivered to the hotel.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user, Jane Smith, is expecting a package. I will use the `check_for_package` tool to see if it has arrived and also respond to her comment.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.check_for_package:
{"guest_name": "Jane Smith"}

tool.check_for_package channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"package_arrived": true, "package_details": {"sender": "Amazon", "size": "medium"}}

assistant channel=analysis:
A package has arrived for the guest. I will now inform her.

assistant channel=final:
We're happy to provide that service for our guests. And I have good news! A medium-sized package from Amazon has arrived for you, Ms. Smith. You can pick it up from the front desk at your convenience.
