That sounds great! We're really excited for the trip. Do you have any recommendations for family-friendly stops along the Blue Ridge Parkway?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide helpful recommendations based on system knowledge about local attractions.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! The Parkway is perfect for families. I recommend stopping at Craggy Pinnacle for the best views (short hike), the Biltmore Estate for a historical visit, and Sliding Rock for some summer fun if the weather permits. All are about 30-45 minutes from here. Drive safely and enjoy your adventure!
