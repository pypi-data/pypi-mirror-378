What time are the regional flights and do you rotate the selection nightly?

Provide timing and rotation note; small talk.

Flights pour 17:30–19:00, and we rotate regions across the week. The water station is beside the table—great for calibrating between pours. Exploring new regions or revisiting favorites?

New regions! Can you share tonight’s exact producer list before I head down?

assistant channel=analysis:
Producer list external; flag.
