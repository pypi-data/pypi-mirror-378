Can you help me reserve a cellar tour this afternoon and tell me when the hotel tasting happens?

Our lobby tasting runs 17:30–19:00 with regional flights, spittoons available on request. For the cellar tour reservation off-site, I’ll coordinate details with their host team and circle back. Meanwhile, would you like stemmed or stemless glassware from the bar?

user:
Stemless please. Do you have water nearby during tasting?

assistant channel=analysis:
Water station adjacent.

assistant channel=final:
Yes, there’s a water station adjacent to the tasting table to rinse your palate.

user:
Can you confirm the cellar’s private slot availability for 16:15 and send the booking link?
