Konnichiwa! I'm staying in your ryokan to experience authentic Japanese culture, and I would love to participate in a traditional tea ceremony. Could I request ceremonial grade matcha for the experience? I want to honor the proper customs and traditions.

Konnichiwa! It brings me great joy that you wish to experience chanoyu in its authentic form. I'll arrange for our finest ceremonial grade matcha—koicha stone-ground from our partner Uji tea gardens—to be prepared in our traditional tea house. The ceremony will be conducted on tatami mats with all proper implements, and I'll personally guide you through the traditional movements and spiritual meaning behind each gesture to ensure you experience the true wa-kei-sei-jaku principles.

We also offer flower arrangement classes using traditional bamboo and seasonal blossoms if you'd like to deepen your understanding of Japanese aesthetic principles.
