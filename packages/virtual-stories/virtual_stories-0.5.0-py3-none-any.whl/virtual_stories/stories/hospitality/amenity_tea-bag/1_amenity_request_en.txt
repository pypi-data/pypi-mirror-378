user:
I'd like to have a cup of tea. Could I get an Earl Grey tea bag?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is requesting a specific type of tea bag. I will use the `request_amenity` tool to fulfill this request.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "earl_grey_tea_bag", "quantity": 1}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "An Earl Grey tea bag will be sent to your room."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I will inform the user that the tea bag is on its way.

assistant channel=final:
Certainly. I have arranged for an Earl Grey tea bag to be delivered to your room. It should arrive shortly. Enjoy your moment of serenity.

user:
Thank you. The garden here is so peaceful.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is making a nice comment about the hotel's garden. I should respond in a friendly and appreciative manner.

assistant channel=final:
We are so glad you are enjoying it. Our gardeners work diligently to create a tranquil space for our guests. It is the perfect place to enjoy a cup of tea.

user:
I'm interested in the tea ceremony tomorrow. How can I sign up?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user wants to sign up for the tea ceremony. I do not have a tool for that. I will use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I can help with that. I'm looking into this.
