user:
Hey there! Love the mural in the lobby—very calming.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; confirm kiosk details.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks—we’re glad it sets the tone. Our SIM kiosk dispenses nano-SIM cards only. If you need activation, bring your passport to the Connectivity Desk between 08:00 and 20:00 for KYC.

user:
My phone takes nano—what plan do you recommend for two weeks?

assistant channel=analysis:
Suggest 20 GB/15 days.

assistant channel=final:
The 20 GB/15-day plan fits a two-week stay well, and you can add voice minutes if needed. If your phone supports eSIM, the QR option is also quick to set up.

user:
Can you activate it remotely now and bind Wi‑Fi calling to my number?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Processing your request for activation steps and feature binding.
