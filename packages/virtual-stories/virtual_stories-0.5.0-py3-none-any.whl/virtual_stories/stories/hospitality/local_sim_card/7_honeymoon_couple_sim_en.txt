I have the SIM card options. I will present them to the user, emphasizing the Unlimited Plan for sharing photos during their honeymoon.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations on your honeymoon! What a beautiful way to celebrate your love in the Maldives! We'd be delighted to help you stay connected during your special time here.

For sharing all those wonderful honeymoon photos and staying in touch with family, I'd recommend our Unlimited Plan at $40. It offers unlimited data, calls, and texts, perfect for uploading photos and video calls.

We also have a Data-Only Plan with 10GB for $20 and a Talk & Text Plan with 5GB for $25, but the Unlimited Plan would ensure you never run out of data while capturing all your magical moments.

user:
The Unlimited Plan sounds perfect for our needs. I'm David Chen and this is my wife Sarah. We're staying in one of your overwater bungalows - it's absolutely breathtaking!

assistant channel=analysis:
The user has chosen the Unlimited Plan. I will use the `purchase_local_sim_card` tool to purchase the SIM card and respond to their comment about the overwater bungalow.

assistant channel=analysis:
The SIM card has been reserved. I will now inform the user and engage in positive conversation about their overwater bungalow.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful choice, Mr. Chen! I've reserved the Unlimited SIM card for you. You can collect it at the front desk with your room key.

How exciting that you're staying in one of our overwater bungalows! They truly offer some of the most breathtaking views in the Maldives. The glass floor panels are perfect for spotting tropical fish while you upload your photos. Many of our honeymoon couples say it's the most romantic setting for sharing their love with family back home.

user:
It really is! We've already spotted several fish through the glass floor. We're so excited to capture and share all these memories. Thank you for your help!

Engage in positive small talk with the guest.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome, Mr. Chen! The glass floor panels are one of our most popular features. With your new Unlimited SIM card, you'll be able to share all those magical underwater moments instantly. Congratulations again on your marriage, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else to make your honeymoon at Azure Bay even more special!
