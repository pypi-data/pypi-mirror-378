We’re 12 people—can we do two blocks back-to-back and hotspot for the rest?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain two-block approach and hotspot allowed; mention kiosk.

Yes—two back-to-back blocks will cover twelve eSIM activations. Hotspot is allowed, and if anyone needs a physical SIM, the kiosk dispenses nano size only.
