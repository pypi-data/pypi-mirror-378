Morning! Your coffee smells incredible—what beans do you use?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; segue to Connectivity Desk.

assistant channel=final:
Good morning! We brew a light-roast single origin in the lobby. If you’re setting up connectivity, our Connectivity Desk is open 08:00–20:00 and can provision eSIM QR codes for CityWave or MetroTel.

user:
I run dual eSIMs—can I keep my home line active and add a 20 GB local plan?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain dual-eSIM general flow and throttling policy.

assistant channel=final:
Yes. You can keep your home eSIM active for calls and add a local 20 GB/15-day plan for data. After you use the quota, speeds drop to 512 kbps, which may cause buffering on video apps.

user:
Is hotspot allowed on those packs? I might work from the room.

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm hotspot and mention hotel Wi‑Fi.

assistant channel=final:
Hotspot tethering is allowed. For heavier tasks, our hotel Wi‑Fi "Harborline-Guest" caps at 200 Mbps per device, and we have private work pods on Level 2 if you need a quieter space.

user:
Can you push the carrier QR to my phone and register my passport now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond context; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks—reviewing available resources for carrier provisioning and KYC submission.
