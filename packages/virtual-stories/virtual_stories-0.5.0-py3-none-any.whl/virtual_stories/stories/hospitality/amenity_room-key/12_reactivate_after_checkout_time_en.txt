I checked out at 11 but left my scarf in 804. Can you reactivate my card so I can grab it?

System allows a 15-minute grace reactivation once; provide steps and limits.

Yes—there’s a one-time 15‑minute grace window. Please stop by the front desk so we can verify your last name and booking email; we’ll encode lobby + 8th floor access for 11:05–11:20.
