Answer using system: late-night re-encode supported at security console; verification needed; mention queue estimate and spare limits.

Yes—after 23:00 we re-encode at the security console by the elevators. I can help right now; we’ll verify your last name and the last 4 of your ID, and it usually takes 3–7 minutes. Note you can have up to two active spares alongside your primary.

How many spares can I have at once?

Directly in system: max concurrent spares is 2.

Up to two active spares per room.
