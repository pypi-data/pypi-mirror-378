Morning is spectacular here! You'll see varied thrushes, winter wrens, and Pacific wrens singing from the Douglas firs. The American dippers are especially active along the streams at dawn, and you might spot bald eagles fishing in the early light. Our morning bird call service can even wake you with local species recordings.
