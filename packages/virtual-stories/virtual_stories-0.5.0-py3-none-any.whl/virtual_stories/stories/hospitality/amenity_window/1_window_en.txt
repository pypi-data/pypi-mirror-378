user:
The window in my room is cracked.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is reporting a cracked window. This is a safety hazard and needs to be addressed immediately. I will send a technician to their room to assess the damage. I will need to ask for their room number.

assistant channel=final:
I'm very sorry to hear that. For your safety, please stay away from the window. What is your room number so I can send someone to take a look at it right away?

user:
I'm in room 2501.

{"room_number": "2501", "issue_description": "The window in the room is cracked."}

tool.send_technician channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A technician has been dispatched to room 2501."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I should now inform the user that a technician is on the way and offer to move them to a new room.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you. A technician is on their way to your room. For your comfort and safety, we would be happy to move you to a new room. Would you like me to arrange that for you?

user:
Yes, please. That would be great.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user wants to move to a new room. I will acknowledge the request and pass it to a background agent to handle the room change.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'm looking into this.
