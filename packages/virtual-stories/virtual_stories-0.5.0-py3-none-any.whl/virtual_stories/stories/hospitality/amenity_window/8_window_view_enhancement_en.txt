This sounds perfect! Lake Louise sunsets must be incredible. By the way, what's your favorite spot for wildlife viewing around here?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about wildlife viewing spots. This doesn't require specific information from my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Lake Louise sunsets are indeed magical! I don't have personal favorites since I focus on our lodge services, but many guests enjoy the various wildlife viewing opportunities in Banff National Park.

user:
Actually, I was wondering about the history of Banff as a tourist destination and how it became such a photography hotspot.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the history of Banff as a tourist destination, which is detailed historical information not available in my basic system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research Banff's tourism history for you.

assistant channel=analysis:
I should offer alternative assistance while the information is being gathered.

assistant channel=final:
While I look into that, I can tell you that Banff has been a premier Canadian destination since the late 1800s. If you'd like, I can provide information about current photography tours or recommend resources about Canadian national parks history.
