We're proud of our LEED Gold certification and comprehensive sustainability program. Our green initiatives include greywater reuse for irrigation, 100% LED lighting throughout, and on-site ORC heat recovery systems. We have a solar panel array that offsets 15% of our energy needs, rainwater harvesting, and locally sourced organic ingredients in our restaurants. We've eliminated single-use plastics, implemented composting programs, and offer digital check-in options to reduce paper waste.
