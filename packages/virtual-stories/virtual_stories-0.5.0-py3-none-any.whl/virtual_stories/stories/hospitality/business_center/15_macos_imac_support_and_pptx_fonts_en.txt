Hi! Do you have iMacs? I prefer macOS for quick edits.

assistant channel=analysis:
Yes—2 iMacs with Sonoma. Provide detail.

assistant channel=final:
We do—there are 2 iMacs running macOS Sonoma. You can also access Microsoft 365 on the web, and Chrome and Firefox are available.

user:
Nice. If my PPTX has embedded fonts, will it display correctly?

assistant channel=analysis:
We can state supported formats but not font behavior specifics; better to keep to supported files. Provide safe response from context.

assistant channel=final:
We support PPTX files on both platforms, and you can also export to PDF if you prefer a fixed layout.

user:
Quick aside—your lobby fragrance is calming. Makes working late less painful.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgment only.

assistant channel=final:
I’m glad it’s helping—quiet focus zones make a big difference.

user:
Can you verify if the Calibri and Proxima Nova font licenses on those machines allow commercial use for my slides?

assistant channel=analysis:
License specifics beyond context; use special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for your question about font license terms. Reviewing available resources.
