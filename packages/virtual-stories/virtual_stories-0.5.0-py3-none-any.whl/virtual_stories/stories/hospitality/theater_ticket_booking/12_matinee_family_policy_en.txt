Matinee performances at Alder Hall welcome children; booster cushions are available at ushers’ stations. Strollers must be checked at the Cedar Street coat room. Family restrooms are on Level 2 near Entrance 1. Late seating policies still apply; noise‑sensitive performances may post advisories at the entrance.
