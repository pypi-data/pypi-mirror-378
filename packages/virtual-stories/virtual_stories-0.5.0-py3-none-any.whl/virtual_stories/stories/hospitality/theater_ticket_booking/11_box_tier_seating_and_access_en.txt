The Alder Performing Arts Hall partners with the hotel for concierge holds on select performances. Box‑tier seats use Entrance 2 on Cedar Street with elevator access to Level 3. Will‑call opens 90 minutes prior to curtain; pre‑order concessions can be picked up at the Cedar Street counter. Late seating is at the usher’s discretion during applause breaks. The hotel can arrange car drop‑off on Cedar with a 5‑minute loading limit.

We can request two box‑tier seats from our concierge hold and arrange a Cedar Street drop‑off—note there’s a 5‑minute loading limit. If you arrive a bit early, will‑call will already be open.
