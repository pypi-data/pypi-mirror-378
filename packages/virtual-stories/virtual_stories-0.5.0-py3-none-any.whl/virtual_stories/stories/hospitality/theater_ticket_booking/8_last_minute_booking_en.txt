Thanks! This is going to be a great end to my day. I might even grab a bite nearby before the show.

The guest is planning to grab dinner before the show. I could offer restaurant recommendations based on my hotel knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
That sounds like a great plan! For a quick bite before the show, I recommend "The Palm" right nearby - they have excellent steaks and fast service. Or if you want something lighter, "Norma's at Parker Meridien" has amazing brunch items they serve all evening. Both are just a 5-minute walk from the theater!

Norma's sounds perfect - I love their brunch items! Thanks for all the great recommendations.

The guest liked the restaurant suggestion. This is a natural close to the conversation.
