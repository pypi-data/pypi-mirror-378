Both preferred shows are available. Phantom of the Opera has better seating options and is at their preferred time. Should recommend orchestra seats for anniversary celebration.

Perfect! "The Phantom of the Opera" is available at 8:00 PM with orchestra seats, which would give you the best view for this romantic classic. "Les Mis√©rables" is also available at 7:30 PM but only mezzanine seats remain. Which would you prefer?
