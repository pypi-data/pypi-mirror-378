Property: Garden Courtyard Hotel. Crib delivery window: 07:00–22:00. Safety spacing: 1 m from heaters/windows; path to bathroom must be clear. Housekeeping sets up and leaves an inspection tag. Inventory typically 12 units on weekdays. Sheets laundered daily.

user:
Good afternoon! How’s your day going?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, then offer timing coordination.

assistant channel=final:
Going well—thanks for asking. We can deliver the crib anytime between 07:00 and 22:00. What window works best with your nap schedule?

user:
Around 6 PM would be ideal. Anything I should move in the room beforehand?

assistant channel=analysis:
Suggest clearing heater/window areas and bathroom path.

assistant channel=final:
If you can free space at least 1 meter from heaters or windows and keep the bathroom path open, that’ll make setup smooth. We’ll handle the rest.

user:
Could you send me the assembly manual PDF for this specific crib model?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Access to the exact assembly documentation requires further review. Searching for more information.
