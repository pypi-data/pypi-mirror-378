Hi! We have three young children with us, and they've gone through all the hotel stationery already. Could we get some more writing paper for their activities?

Of course! We love having families with creative children. Our children's stationery collection includes colorful lined paper, drawing paper, construction paper, and story paper with picture spaces. We also have washable markers and crayons. How many children are with you, and what activities are they working on?

We have three kids - ages 5, 7, and 9. They're doing drawings, stories, and some math games. The story paper with pictures sounds perfect!

Perfect! For your 5-year-old, the story paper with picture spaces is ideal for early writing development. Your 7-year-old will love the colorful lined paper for stories, and the 9-year-old can use graph paper for math games. We also have bilingual options if they're learning Spanish. Shall I send a complete art kit to your room?

This week features our "Animal Adventure" theme with daily art workshops, nature journaling, and story writing about wildlife. The kids create their own adventure books with drawings and stories about animals they might see on our property. It's been very popular with children aged 4-10!
