user:
I’m in 614. Can you swap the duvet cover around 12:30?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check windows then schedule slot 12:00–14:00 for 614, queen/king unknown—ask? But the user requested swap around 12:30; assume size from system? Not provided. Ask for size would break flow; instead, schedule specifying slot only if system allows size-less? Tool requires size; we need size from user. So ask a clarifying question first.

assistant channel=final:
Happy to set that up. Do you have a queen or king bed in 614 so I can place the correct cover?

user:
It’s a queen.

assistant channel=analysis:
Now schedule queen in 12:00–14:00 block.

assistant channel=final:
All set. Duvet cover (queen) is scheduled between 12:00–14:00. Reference DLH-SCH-4410.

user:
By the way, the lobby cactus display is cute.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledge.

assistant channel=final:
It adds a fun local touch.

user:
What detergent scent do you use here?

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’ll check on that.
