What are the differences between the toaster models you have available?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about toaster model differences, which are clearly detailed in the system prompt under Available Toaster Models and Model-Specific Features. I can provide comprehensive comparison information.

assistant channel=final:
We have two toaster models available: the Dualit Mini Classic (2-slice) and the Cuisinart Compact (4-slice). The Dualit features traditional British design with manual controls, chrome finish, and 800W power consumption. The Cuisinart has a modern digital interface with touch controls, stainless steel finish, and 1200W power for faster toasting. Both have 7 browning levels, automatic shutoff, and cool-touch exteriors. The Dualit is perfect for individuals, while the Cuisinart is ideal for families or groups needing to toast more bread at once.

user:
Which model would you recommend for someone staying for a week?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for a recommendation for a week-long stay, which relates to the usage guidelines and capacity options mentioned in the system prompt. I can provide personalized recommendations based on their stay duration.

assistant channel=final:
For a week-long stay, I'd recommend the Cuisinart Compact 4-slice model. It offers more capacity for multiple people or if you want to prepare breakfast for guests, and the digital controls make it easier to achieve consistent results. The 1200W power means faster toasting, which is convenient when you're getting ready in the morning. Plus, the stainless steel finish is more durable for extended use. Both models are available on a first-come, first-served basis, so I can arrange delivery of your preferred model.

user:
The sourdough bread from the bakery cart is so fresh and delicious.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about the hotel's bakery service, which relates to the morning bakery cart mentioned in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! Our morning bakery cart features fresh sourdough made daily using traditional San Francisco techniques. The bread is baked with a 24-hour fermentation process using locally sourced flour, which gives it that authentic tangy flavor and chewy texture that pairs perfectly with our toaster options.

user:
Can you customize the toaster models or create a hybrid version with features from both models?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about customizing toaster models or creating hybrid versions, which goes beyond what's available in the system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since no tools or system knowledge covers toaster customization or hybrid model creation.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand your request. Reviewing available resources.
