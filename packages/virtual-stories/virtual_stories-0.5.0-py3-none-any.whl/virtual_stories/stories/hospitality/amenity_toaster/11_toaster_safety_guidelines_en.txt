If you encounter any issues, immediately unplug the toaster and move it away from any flammable materials. Your kitchenette has a hardwired smoke alarm with battery backup, and there's a Class K fire extinguisher mounted near the kitchenette entrance. The exhaust fan will automatically activate during cooking. If there's any emergency, our 24/7 security team is trained in medical response and has direct connection to emergency services. You can also contact the front desk immediately for assistance.

The sourdough from the bakery cart this morning was incredible!

This is casual small talk about the hotel's bakery service, which relates to the morning bakery cart mentioned in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
I'm so glad you enjoyed it! Our morning bakery cart features fresh sourdough slices and croissants made daily. The sourdough is baked using traditional San Francisco techniques with a 24-hour fermentation process for that authentic tangy flavor.

Can you modify the toaster's electrical system to increase its power output or add custom safety features?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about modifying the toaster's electrical system or adding custom safety features, which goes beyond what's available in the system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since no tools or system knowledge covers electrical modifications or custom safety feature installation.
