How should I clean the toaster properly? I want to make sure I'm doing it right.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about toaster cleaning procedures, which are clearly detailed in the system prompt under Toaster Cleaning & Maintenance Procedures. I can provide comprehensive cleaning instructions.

assistant channel=final:
Here's the proper cleaning procedure: First, always unplug the toaster before cleaning. Remove the crumb tray and empty any crumbs or debris. Use a soft brush to clean the interior heating elements, then wipe the exterior with a damp cloth and mild dish soap. Avoid abrasive cleaners that could damage the finish. After cleaning, allow the toaster to air dry completely before plugging it back in. For weekly deep cleaning, you can also use the sanitizing wipes we provide in your kitchenette for extra disinfection.

The croissants from the bakery cart were absolutely perfect this morning.

This is casual small talk about the hotel's bakery service, which relates to the morning bakery cart mentioned in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
I'm delighted you enjoyed them! Our morning bakery cart features fresh croissants made daily using traditional French techniques. The pastry chef uses European butter and a 48-hour fermentation process to achieve that perfect flaky texture and rich flavor.

Can you install additional cleaning features or modify the toaster to include self-cleaning capabilities?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about installing additional cleaning features or modifying the toaster for self-cleaning capabilities, which goes beyond what's available in the system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since no tools or system knowledge covers toaster modifications or self-cleaning feature installation.
