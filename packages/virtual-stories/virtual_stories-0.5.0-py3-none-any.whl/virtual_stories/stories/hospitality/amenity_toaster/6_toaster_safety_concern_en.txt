Do you have any recommendations for the best type of bread to toast? I want to make sure I'm using the toaster correctly.

Actually, I think I'll just use the bread from your bakery cart. The sourdough sounds perfect for toasting.

Excellent choice! Our morning bakery cart has fresh sourdough slices that are perfect for toasting. Sourdough toasts beautifully and has that wonderful San Francisco flavor. The toaster will bring out the best in it!
