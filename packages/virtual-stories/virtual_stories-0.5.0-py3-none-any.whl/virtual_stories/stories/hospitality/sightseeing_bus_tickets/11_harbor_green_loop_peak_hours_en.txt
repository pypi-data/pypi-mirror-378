Good morning! Beautiful day by the water, isn’t it?

assistant channel=final:
It really is—clear skies make the harbor sparkle. How can I help with your plans today?

user:
We’re thinking about the Harbor Green Loop. When’s the first bus from the hotel stop?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from system: first coach 08:00; pickups every 30 minutes until 19:30 last boarding.

assistant channel=final:
The first Harbor Green Loop coach from our West Entrance—Stop G17—departs at 08:00, then every 30 minutes through the day. Last boarding from this stop is at 19:30.

user:
Nice. We’ve got two adults and one child, age 9. What’s the best ticket option?

assistant channel=analysis:
Family bundle: $95 covers 2 adults + up to 2 children ages 6–12.

assistant channel=final:
The Family bundle at $95 will be best—it covers both adults and your 9-year-old. It’s valid for the day until 20:00 and activates on your first scan.

user:
Do you have any student discounts?

assistant channel=analysis:
System says no student discounts in current agreement. Provide that.

assistant channel=final:
Our current partner agreement doesn’t include a student discount on the Harbor Green Loop.

user:
All good. Can you hold three wristbands under room 1524? We’ll swing by after coffee.

assistant channel=analysis:
System: concierge can hold tickets for 20 minutes under a room number.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—I’ll hold three QR wristbands under room 1524 for 20 minutes. Enjoy your coffee.

user:
One more: Can we get a combo with the Aquarium across town for this afternoon?

assistant channel=analysis:
System says Aquarium combo is not part of offerings. This is beyond the supported catalog; per user request, we must end with special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for checking—ticketing for the Aquarium combo isn’t in our current onsite offerings. Investigating potential options.
