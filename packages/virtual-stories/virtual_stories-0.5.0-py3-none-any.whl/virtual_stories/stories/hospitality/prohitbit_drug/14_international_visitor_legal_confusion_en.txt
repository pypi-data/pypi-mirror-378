Hello, I'm visiting from the Netherlands where cannabis is legal in coffee shops. I'm confused about what's allowed here during my stay.

assistant channel=analysis:
This international guest is from the Netherlands where cannabis laws are different, and they're genuinely confused about local policies. I should explain our property policy clearly while being culturally sensitive and offering educational resources.

assistant channel=final:
I understand the confusion with different laws between countries. Regardless of home country regulations, our property maintains universal prohibition of illicit drugs throughout all areas. However, we have multilingual policy documentation and a Diplomatic Information Center with resources about local laws and regulatory differences to help clarify these distinctions.

That makes sense—I want to respect local regulations. Are there other cultural differences I should be aware of?

I have prescription medication from my home country. Will that be accepted here?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about their prescription medication from their home country. Our policy permits prescription medications with valid home country or international medical documentation, so this should be fine.

Yes, prescription medications for personal medical treatment are permitted with valid home country or international medical documentation. As long as you have proper prescription documentation from the Netherlands, your medication will be accepted here.

user:
What specific international treaty governs cross-border prescription medication recognition?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about specific international treaties governing prescription medication recognition, which would involve detailed international law not covered in my system knowledge. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

Absolutely. The Diplomatic Information Center staff are well-versed in helping international guests understand local regulations and legal differences. They'll be able to provide comprehensive guidance about navigating local requirements during your stay.
