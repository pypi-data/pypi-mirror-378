user:
I have some important documents that I need to keep safe. What do you recommend?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about document storage. I should explain the fireproof bags and business center lockers.

assistant channel=final:
We have a couple of options for you. You can purchase a fireproof document bag from our gift shop, or you can use a secure locker in our business center.

user:
How much do the lockers in the business center cost?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about the cost of the lockers. I should provide the daily fee.

assistant channel=final:
The lockers are available for a fee of $10 per day.

user:
That's reasonable. Is the business center open all the time?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking a chitchat question about the business center hours. I can confirm 24/7 access.

assistant channel=final:
Yes, our business center is open 24/7, and you can access your locker at any time with your personal key code.

user:
I need to have a document signed and witnessed. Can someone from the hotel act as a witness?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for a hotel employee to witness a document signing. This is a legal matter that the hotel cannot get involved in. I should use the [ATTENTION] flag and suggest the notary service.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Our staff cannot act as a legal witness for documents. However, we do have a certified notary public available by appointment. I am looking into their availability for you.
