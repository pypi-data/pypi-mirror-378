Audio via directional speakers; subtitles enabled. Outside food discouraged; pool bar offers kids’ snack boxes. Float use allowed until 20:00; then swimmers must clear the main sightline.

user:
Is the family animation still on tonight, and can we bring our own popcorn?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm schedule and food policy per system; small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—showtime is 19:30–21:15 if the weather cooperates. We’ve got loungers and low chairs set up, towels at the Towel Hut, and subtitles on if that helps little readers. We discourage outside food, but the pool bar has kids’ snack boxes and fresh popcorn ready.

user:
Could we reserve front-row loungers?

assistant channel=analysis:
Reservation specifics beyond the system. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about seating—this request is being coordinated now.
