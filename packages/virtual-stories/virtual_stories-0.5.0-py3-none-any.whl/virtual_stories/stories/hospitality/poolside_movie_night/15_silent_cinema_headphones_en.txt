system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Standard audio via directional speakers with subtitles; no headset distribution in standard setup. Quiet hours for pool deck begin 22:00.

user:
Do you offer wireless headphones for a quiet watch?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain current setup; mention subtitles; small talk.

assistant channel=final:
We currently run directional speakers tuned for the deck and keep subtitles on for clarity. It’s a surprisingly immersive setup—and it keeps the surrounding walkways calmer, too. Quiet hours begin at 22:00.

user:
Could you add a limited set of headsets for tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Adding headsets beyond context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Appreciate the thoughtful idea—we’re checking whether that headset option can be arranged.
