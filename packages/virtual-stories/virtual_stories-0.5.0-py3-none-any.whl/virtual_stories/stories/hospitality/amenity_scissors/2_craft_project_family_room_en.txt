user:
The kids are so excited about the resort. What's the best time for the playground?

assistant channel=analysis:
Chitchat about family amenities - information available in system prompt about children's program features.

assistant channel=final:
Our playground is open from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM daily! The shaded areas are perfect for Orlando's sunshine, and we have character appearances every afternoon. The indoor play area is available 24/7 for those early risers or late-night energy bursts.

user:
Will these scissors work well with construction paper or should we use something else?

assistant channel=analysis:
Craft material compatibility with scissors isn't specified in tools or system prompt - requires ATTENTION flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Let me check scissors compatibility with different craft materials. Reviewing specifications.
