Hello! The hallway art is adorable. What are the playroom hours today, and can my 5‑year‑old use it?

assistant channel=analysis:
Greet back, confirm hours and eligible ages; mention caregiver rule.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—we rotate those little seascapes seasonally. The playroom runs 09:00–19:00 daily for ages 3–10, and a caregiver needs to stay with them the whole time.

user:
Is there a quiet window for naps? Also, where do strollers go?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide Quiet Hour and stroller parking info.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—Quiet Hour is 13:00–14:00 for low‑stimulus activities. Strollers can be parked in the alcove just outside the room.

user:
Could we do a tiny cupcake birthday at 16:00 inside the playroom?

assistant channel=analysis:
Food is not allowed inside; snacks only at hallway table. Provide sanitization times that may affect planning.

assistant channel=final:
Inside the playroom we keep it food‑free, but you’re welcome to use the hallway snack table for cupcakes. Note we sanitize surfaces at 18:45 for about 15 minutes.

user:
Can you hold the space for us at 16:00 for about 30 minutes?

assistant channel=analysis:
Assistant cannot place holds or bookings; end with special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I don’t have the ability to place holds or bookings for the playroom. I’m seeing what we can do to accommodate your 16:00 plan.
