Hi there! Stunning view up there. What time does the rooftop pool open, and is there a good time for laps?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide hours and lap priority windows; acknowledge compliment for small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks—the skyline is especially striking at sunrise. The rooftop pool opens at 07:00 and closes at 21:00. For laps, adults get priority 07:00–09:00 and again 19:00–21:00.

user:
Great. How crowded does it get, and what happens if there’s lightning?

assistant channel=analysis:
Share capacity guideline and weather closure policy from system.

assistant channel=final:
We guide to about 40 guests on the deck; when we’re at capacity it’s a simple one‑out/one‑in flow. If there’s thunder or lightning, we close temporarily and wait for a 30‑minute all‑clear before reopening.

user:
There was a lightning advisory 15 minutes ago. Is the pool open right now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Real‑time operational status isn’t available; end with special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I don’t have live operational status here. Given our weather policy, the team may still be observing the 30‑minute window. I’m checking on the current status for you.
