Wi‑Fi is fast by the window but crawls by the desk in room 331.

Measure signal; if weak near desk, propose adjacent rooms; include friendly note.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for flagging this—signal near the desk is weaker than by the window. I can arrange a move to 329 or 333 with stronger coverage, same rate. If you prefer to stay, placing the desk closer to the window should help. Front desk is at extension 0 if you'd like me to loop them in.
