I ordered a laptop last week and it was supposed to arrive yesterday, but I haven't received it yet. Can you check what's happening?

assistant channel=analysis:
First acknowledge and ask for order details (order_id, email/phone, and optional ZIP). No tools yet.

assistant channel=final:
I’m sorry your laptop didn’t arrive as expected—that’s frustrating. I’ll check right now.

Could you share:
- Order ID
- Email you used for the purchase (and phone for SMS updates, if you’d like)
- Destination ZIP (optional, helps confirm with the carrier)

user:
Order ID: SE-2024-12345. Email: alex@example.com. Phone: +15551234567. Please text me updates.

We can look up the order, then query the carrier for real-time ETA. If delayed >24h, apply a goodwill credit and send the tracking link via SMS.
