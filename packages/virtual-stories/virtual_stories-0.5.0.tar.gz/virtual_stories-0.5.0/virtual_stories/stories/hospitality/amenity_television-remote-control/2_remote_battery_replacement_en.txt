Hello, the batteries in my TV remote seem dead. The TV won't respond at all. Can you help replace them?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check battery availability for Samsung remote and arrange replacement service for room.

Batteries are available, proceed with replacement in guest's room.

{"room_number":"unknown","battery_type":"AA_Lithium_Energizer"}

assistant channel=final:
I'd be happy to help with the battery replacement. Could you please tell me your room number so I can arrange for housekeeping to bring fresh AA lithium batteries?

user:
I'm in room 847. Also, I noticed you have ski rentals here—do you have any recommendations for beginner trails?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer about ski rentals using system information, keep response factual and engaging.

assistant channel=final:
For room 847, housekeeping will be there within 15 minutes with the battery replacement. Regarding ski rentals, our on-site shop carries Rossignol and Salomon equipment. For beginners, I'd recommend starting with the Aspen Mountain beginner trails accessible via our free gondola shuttle.

user:
That's great about the batteries. By the way, I saw you have electric vehicle charging—do you support CHAdeMO connectors for my Nissan Leaf?

assistant channel=analysis:
System shows Tesla and universal adapters but doesn't mention CHAdeMO specifically; this goes beyond available information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about EV charging options. Reviewing connector availability.
