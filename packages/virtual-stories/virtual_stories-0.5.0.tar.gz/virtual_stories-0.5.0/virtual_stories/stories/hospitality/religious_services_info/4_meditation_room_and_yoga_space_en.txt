Hello! Do you have a meditation room? Also, how’s the weather up here today?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer meditation room; small talk about weather without tools—keep it light since weather is not required.

assistant channel=final:
We do—our Tranquility Studio on Level 1 is open 07:00–21:00 with mats and bolsters provided. We also host a complimentary sunrise mindfulness session 06:30–06:50 on the Sequoia Terrace, and mornings there are typically calm for quiet practice.

Nice! Is there a place I can sit quietly late at night if I can’t sleep?

assistant channel=analysis:
Mention Quiet Reflection Nook 24/7.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the Quiet Reflection Nook behind the lobby is open 24/7, with seating for up to four. It stays dim and peaceful for late-night unwinding.

Great. Are yoga mats available, or should I bring my own?
