Yes—our next Interfaith Panel is Thursday at 18:30 in Harbor Hall. We offer assistive listening devices, wheelchair-accessible seating in rows A and B, and can arrange an ASL interpreter with 24 hours’ notice. Would you like me to note any support for you?

That’s great. Could you hold an accessible seat and an assistive device? And, how’s the harbor view around sunset?
