If there’s a power outage, can I still borrow one?

Check emergency stock status via tool and answer per output.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—emergency backup units are reserved for outages. Standard lending still applies: one per room for a 24‑hour courtesy period; after 24 hours a $20 hold may apply. Front Desk pickup and return.

user:
That’s reassuring.

assistant channel=final:
Glad to help.

user:
Could I keep it for a month just in case?

assistant channel=analysis:
Month‑long checkout isn’t described; use special flag.

[ATTENTION] Month‑long checkout isn’t covered in these resources. Reviewing available resources.
