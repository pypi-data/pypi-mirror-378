The Ethiopian Yirgacheffe is exceptional! It's a light-medium roast from 1800-2000m altitude with bright citrus and floral notes plus wine-like acidity. It's washed processed and freshly roasted by Emerald City Coffee Co. on August 27th. Perfect for pour-over brewing to highlight those delicate flavors.
