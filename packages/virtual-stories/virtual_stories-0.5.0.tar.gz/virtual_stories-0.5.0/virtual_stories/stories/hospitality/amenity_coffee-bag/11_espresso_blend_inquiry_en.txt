Hi! I'm staying in room 2145 and I'm really into espresso. Do you have any coffee blends that would work well for espresso brewing?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about espresso blends specifically. I need to provide information about which of our available coffee options would work well for espresso brewing, focusing on the darker roasts and blends that are typically used for espresso.

assistant channel=final:
Hello! For espresso brewing, I'd recommend our Pacific Northwest Dark Blend - it's specifically crafted for espresso with rich, bold flavors that work beautifully with espresso extraction. We also have Pike Place Signature Whole Bean which is excellent for espresso when ground fine. Both are available in 12oz bags for $24 and $22 respectively. Would you like me to arrange delivery of either blend to room 2145?

user:
The Pacific Northwest Dark Blend sounds perfect! I love that it's specifically crafted for espresso. Can you deliver it to my room?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to order the Pacific Northwest Dark Blend for room delivery. I need to provide information about delivery options and timing.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice! The Pacific Northwest Dark Blend is perfect for espresso. I'll arrange delivery to room 2145 - it should arrive within 25 minutes. Since the bag is $24, there's a $5 delivery fee, making the total $29. The bag will be delivered to your room, and you can use the premium coffee maker in your room for brewing.

user:
Perfect! I'm really enjoying the harbor view from my room - it's absolutely stunning, especially with the morning light.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is making small talk about the harbor view, which is mentioned in the system prompt as a feature of room 2145. This is a nice chitchat moment that doesn't require any tools.

assistant channel=final:
I'm so glad you're enjoying the harbor view! Room 2145 does have one of our best panoramic harbor views with those floor-to-ceiling windows. The morning light reflecting off the water is truly spectacular. Your Pacific Northwest Dark Blend should be arriving shortly for your espresso brewing!

user:
It really is magical! Do you know if there are any local espresso bars or coffee shops that specialize in espresso that I should check out?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about local espresso bars and coffee shops, which goes beyond the system prompt information about hotel amenities and services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since I don't have access to local business recommendations.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about local espresso bars. Reviewing available resources.

user:
No worries, I'll ask the concierge. Thanks for your help with the coffee!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is thanking me and ending the conversation. I should provide a friendly closing response.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! Enjoy your espresso with the beautiful harbor view. Have a wonderful morning!
