That sounds wonderful! Could you arrange a sustainable coffee tasting experience for me?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to arrange a sustainable coffee tasting experience. I should coordinate this with our educational services and provide details about the tasting format.

assistant channel=final:
I'd be delighted to arrange a sustainable coffee tasting experience! We'll schedule a 45-minute session in our eco-education center where you can sample our fair-trade selections while learning about the environmental impact of each origin.

Yes, please book the sustainability workshop for after my coffee tasting. Also, what's your carbon offset program?

I've booked your sustainability workshop for right after your coffee tasting session! For our carbon offset program, we calculate the carbon footprint of all resort activities and offset 100% through verified reforestation projects and renewable energy credits.
