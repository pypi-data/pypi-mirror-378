user:
Hi—812. Please sync my calendar (Microsoft) so the tablet shows the next meeting, and give me a secure print PIN for L2.

assistant channel=analysis:
Run calendar preview for Microsoft; generate print PIN. Add small talk about coffee hours.

assistant channel=final:
Connected—your next event shows as “Team briefing tomorrow 09:30, Room Jefferson B.” Your secure pull‑print PIN is 428913 for the L2 printer. Lobby café pours coffee 6:00–14:00 if you need a pre‑meeting boost.

user:
Great—anything else I should know?

assistant channel=analysis:
Remind that PIN is one‑time and expires at checkout.

assistant channel=final:
The PIN is one‑time and expires at check‑out; you can generate another anytime.
