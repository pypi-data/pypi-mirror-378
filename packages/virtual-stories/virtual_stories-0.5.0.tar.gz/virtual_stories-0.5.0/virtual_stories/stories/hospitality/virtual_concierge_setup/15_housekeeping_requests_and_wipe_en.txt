system:
HarborVoice Mini can request towels and housekeeping via internal messaging. Voice profiles up to two, created on the tablet, and wiped at checkout alongside device logs. Scenes: Relax, Focus, Goodnight, Harbor Welcome. DND by voice syncs with room signage. Mic mute switch cuts mics with red LED. No external transactions.

user:
Hi! Can I try something fun—“Harbor, send two extra towels.” Will that ping housekeeping?

assistant channel=final:
Yes—towel requests go straight to housekeeping through our internal system, and you’ll hear a confirmation chime.

user:
After I check out, will my voice and requests remain on the device?

assistant channel=analysis:
Profiles and logs wiped at checkout.

assistant channel=final:
They won’t—the device wipes voice profiles and logs at checkout.

user:
Could you export my voice profile so I can reuse it next time?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Profile export isn’t included in the in‑room configuration. I’ll forward this feature request for background assessment.
