Hey there—can you pair the Echo in 542 to my guest account? I prefer the wake word “Computer,” and please keep the mic muted by default.

assistant channel=analysis:
Perform pairing then set privacy. Include a brief small talk line related to skiing season.

All set—the Echo is paired to a temporary account, wake word “Computer,” and the mic starts muted. If you’re heading to the slopes, ski lockers are on level B2.

The heated pool is open 8:00–20:00—great for a soak after a long day.
