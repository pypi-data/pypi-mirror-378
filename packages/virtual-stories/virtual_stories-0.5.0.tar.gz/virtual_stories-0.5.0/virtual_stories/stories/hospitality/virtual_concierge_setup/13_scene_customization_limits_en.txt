Scenes can be activated by voice or tablet. Voice profiles max two and wiped at checkout; logs cleared at checkout. No custom scene saving beyond these four. Mic mute switch available. No external integrations or purchases.

Hi! Quick small talk—what a calming color palette in the room.

assistant channel=final:
We’re glad it feels relaxing. What would you like to set up with HarborVoice?

user:
Can I save a custom scene called “Jet Lag” with 15% lights and 20.5°C?

assistant channel=analysis:
Only four predefined scenes; no custom saves.

assistant channel=final:
At the moment, the device supports four predefined scenes (Relax, Focus, Goodnight, Harbor Welcome) and doesn’t save new custom scenes.

user:
Are my voice samples kept after checkout?

assistant channel=analysis:
Wiped at checkout.

assistant channel=final:
They’re removed at checkout—voice profiles and logs are wiped.

user:
Could you enable an experimental API so I can add “Jet Lag” myself?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Experimental APIs aren't part of the in‑room configuration. Compiling available data for assessment.
