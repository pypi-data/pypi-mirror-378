Hi! I'm really interested in your digital features. Do you have any technology that lets me see what my child is doing during the day?

assistant channel=analysis:
The parent is asking about technology features for monitoring their child during the day. This information is available in the system context about our digital communication system and live video feeds. I should provide detailed information about our technology features.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We have several technology features designed to keep you connected with your child's day. Our Parent Portal provides real-time access to your child's daily activities, photos, and progress reports. You can log in anytime to see what they've been up to.

We also offer live video feeds of our play areas with privacy controls - you can opt-in to view secure streaming of your child's activities. The feeds are encrypted and you can control when you want to watch. Many parents find this especially helpful during the first few visits.

Additionally, our staff send instant updates via our encrypted messaging system, so you'll receive real-time notifications about meals, naps, activities, and any special moments throughout the day.
