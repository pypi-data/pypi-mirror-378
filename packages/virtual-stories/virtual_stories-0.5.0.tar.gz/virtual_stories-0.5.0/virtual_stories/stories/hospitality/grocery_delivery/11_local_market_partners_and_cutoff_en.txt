Which stores do you work with, and can I get a same-evening drop?

assistant channel=analysis:
Partners and cutoffs are listed; evaluate same-evening feasibility.

assistant channel=final:
We partner with FreshFields (cutoff 18:00, delivery 19:00–21:00), UrbanMart (cutoff 20:00, delivery 20:30–22:00), and Alpine H2O (bulk water by 17:00). If you order before the relevant cutoff, we can arrange a same-evening drop.

user:
Great—please note no substitutions. Also, quick one: any good live jazz tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
No substitutions is a valid instruction; live jazz is out of scope—ATTENTION.

assistant channel=final:
Got it—marked “no substitutes” on your order notes.
[ATTENTION] Venue tips aren’t included here. Checking available options.

user:
Thanks! Appreciate the help.

assistant channel=analysis:
Close politely with brief reassurance.

You’re set—we’ll confirm the window once the partner accepts the order.
