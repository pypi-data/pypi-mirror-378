The guest is asking about scone etiquette specifically. I have detailed information about proper scone consumption that I can share from my system knowledge.

Absolutely! The key with scones is to break them by hand rather than cutting, then add jam first followed by cream, and take small bites. It's really quite simple once you try it - shall I show you when your tea arrives?

Perfect question! Hold the handle with your thumb and index finger, support with your middle finger underneath. And despite what many think, keep your pinky naturally positioned - never extended. It's all about comfort and elegance.
