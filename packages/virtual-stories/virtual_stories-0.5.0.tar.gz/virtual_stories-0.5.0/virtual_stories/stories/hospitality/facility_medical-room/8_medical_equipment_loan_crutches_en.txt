user:
Hello, I sprained my ankle pretty badly last night and the doctor told me I need to stay off it for a few days. Do you have crutches I could borrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is a legitimate medical equipment loan request. The guest has seen a doctor and received medical advice, which is good. I need to check crutch availability and ensure proper fitting for their safety and mobility.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.check_mobility_equipment:
{"equipment_type": "crutches"}

tool.check_mobility_equipment channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"available": true, "underarm_crutches": {"small": 2, "medium": 3, "large": 2}, "forearm_crutches": 2, "all_sanitized": true, "safety_inspected": "today"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Great availability across all sizes. I should get their details for proper fitting and explain our fitting service to ensure they can use the crutches safely.

assistant channel=final:
I'm sorry to hear about your ankle injury! Yes, we have several pairs of adjustable underarm crutches available, all freshly sanitized and safety-checked today. To fit them properly for you, I'll need to know your approximate height and which ankle is injured. Proper fitting is really important for your comfort and safety. How tall are you?

user:
I'm about 5'8" and it's my left ankle that's sprained. I've never used crutches before, so I'm not really sure what I'm doing.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.fit_crutches:
{"guest_height": "5'8\"", "weight": "not specified", "injury_side": "left ankle"}

tool.fit_crutches channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"crutches_selected": "medium underarm crutches", "height_adjustment": "set to 5'8\" range", "proper_fit_achieved": true, "gait_training_recommended": true}

assistant channel=analysis:
Perfect fit accomplished. Since they're a first-time user, I need to provide comprehensive instruction on proper crutch use, safety, and walking technique.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect - I've selected medium underarm crutches and adjusted them for your 5'8" height. Since you're new to crutches, let me show you the proper technique. The crutch tops should fit snugly under your armpits but not press hard. Put your weight on your hands, not your armpits, and keep the injured left foot off the ground. Let me demonstrate the walking pattern.

user:
Okay, this feels weird but I think I'm getting it. How do I go up and down stairs safely?

assistant channel=analysis:
Stair navigation is one of the most challenging and dangerous aspects of crutch use. I need to provide clear, detailed safety instructions and may want to suggest alternatives when possible.

assistant channel=final:
Great question - stairs are the trickiest part! For going up: good foot first, then crutches. Going down: crutches first, then good foot. Remember "up with the good, down with the bad." Always use handrails when available, and consider taking elevators instead of stairs whenever possible during your recovery. Want me to walk through a practice step with you?

user:
That would be really helpful! I want to make sure I don't fall and make things worse.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is being appropriately cautious, which is excellent for safety. I should provide hands-on practice in a safe environment and reinforce safety principles.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely smart thinking! Let's practice here where it's safe. We'll simulate a step. First, position both crutches on the lower level, hold the handrail with one hand if available, then step down with your good right foot. The key is never rushing - take your time, maintain balance, and if you feel unsteady, stop and reposition. Safety first, always.

user:
This is starting to make more sense. How long can I keep these crutches?

assistant channel=analysis:
I should explain our loan policy and also provide guidance about their recovery timeline, encouraging them to follow up with their doctor as their ankle heals.

assistant channel=final:
You can keep them for up to 14 days at no charge - just authorization with your room number. Most ankle sprains improve significantly in 3-5 days, so you may not need them the full time. I recommend checking with your doctor about when you can start putting weight on the ankle again. We'll do a quick check-in call in 3 days to see how you're managing.

user:
That's very thoughtful! I really appreciate how much care you're taking with this fitting and instruction.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is expressing gratitude for the thorough service. This is a good moment for some encouraging chitchat about their recovery and to reinforce that they made the right choice seeking proper mobility support.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! Taking time for proper fitting and instruction prevents so many problems down the road. I see too many people struggling with poorly fitted crutches. You're being smart about your recovery - following doctor's orders and using proper mobility aids. That ankle will heal much better when you're not putting weight on it. Here's a instruction card with all the tips we covered.

user:
Perfect! One last question - what if I need to adjust the height later?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is a practical question about ongoing maintenance and adjustments. I should show them how to make adjustments safely and when to seek help.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Good question about crutch height adjustments during your recovery period. Let me show you the adjustment mechanism and safety guidelines.
