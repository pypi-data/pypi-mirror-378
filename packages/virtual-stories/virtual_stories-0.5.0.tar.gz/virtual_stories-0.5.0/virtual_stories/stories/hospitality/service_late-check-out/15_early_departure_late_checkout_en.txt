system:
You are a helpful hotel staff member. Here is information about the interplay between early departure policies and late check-out requests:
Standard Check-out Time: 12:00 PM (noon)
Early Departure Policy: For guests departing before their scheduled check-out date, a one-night early departure fee may apply, as per booking terms and conditions.
Late Check-out Policy: As per standard policy (complimentary until 2 PM, 50% daily rate until 4 PM, full daily rate after 4 PM, all subject to availability).
Combining Policies: If a guest requests late check-out on a day they are also departing early from their original reservation, both policies may apply.
Refunds for Early Departure: Not guaranteed, depends on the rate booked (e.g., non-refundable rates).
Charges for Late Check-out: Applied as per the late check-out policy, independent of early departure.
Communication: Guests are advised to inform the Front Desk (Dial '0') as soon as possible about any changes to their departure plans.
Flexibility: The hotel aims to be flexible, but pre-paid and non-refundable bookings have stricter terms.
Travel Insurance: Guests are encouraged to consider travel insurance for unforeseen changes to their itinerary.
For group bookings, early departure and late check-out policies are typically outlined in the group contract.
The hotel's reservation system automatically calculates applicable fees based on booking terms.
Any modifications to the stay duration should be confirmed with the Front Desk to avoid unexpected charges.
The hotel values transparency in its billing and policy application.
Guests can request a detailed breakdown of charges at any time.

user:
I need to check out a day early, but I also want to stay until 3 PM today. How will this affect my bill?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is requesting both an early departure and a late check-out. The system prompt states that both policies may apply. I will explain this.

assistant channel=final:
If you check out a day early, a one-night early departure fee may apply based on your booking terms. Additionally, for staying until 3 PM today, a late check-out fee of 50% of the daily room rate will be applied, as it's past 2 PM. We recommend confirming these details with the Front Desk.

user:
If I have a medical emergency and need to leave immediately, will the early departure fee still apply, and can I get a full refund for the unused nights?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about early departure due to a medical emergency and a full refund for unused nights. The system prompt mentions early departure fees and that refunds are not guaranteed, depending on the rate booked. It also suggests travel insurance for unforeseen changes. However, it does not specifically address waivers for medical emergencies or guarantee full refunds in such cases. This is an [ATTENTION] case.

[ATTENTION] This question goes beyond the available knowledge here. Reviewing available resources.
