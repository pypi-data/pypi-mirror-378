Thank you! Do you recommend near-window placement at night?

Stick to given placement guidance.

assistant channel=final:
For nighttime routines, the desk with soft LED provides consistent lighting. Near-window placement is best during daylight.

Great. Also, are the hydrangeas blooming in the garden now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope—flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’ll check the current bloom status in the garden. Investigating potential answers.
