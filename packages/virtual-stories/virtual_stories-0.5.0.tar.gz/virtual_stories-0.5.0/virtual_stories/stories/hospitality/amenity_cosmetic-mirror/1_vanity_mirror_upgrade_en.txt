That sounds incredible! You guys really know how to take care of your guests. Do you know anything about the history of this hotel building?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is very satisfied with the vanity service and now making casual conversation about the hotel's history. This is chitchat that doesn't require tools - I can share some basic information about our historic château setting.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you so much! Our château dates back to the 1700s and was actually owned by a prominent wine-making family before becoming a luxury hotel. The stone walls and wine cellars you see throughout the property are original to the estate. Many celebrities have stayed here over the decades, so you're following in some very glamorous footsteps for your red carpet night!
