Lager Service:
1) Lagers and pilsners are brightest ice‑cold (32–35°F).
2) Chilled (38–42°F) softens carbonation slightly for gentler mouthfeel.
3) Glassware: Pilsner flute for pilsners, classic lager glass for others.
4) Delivery includes a fresh glass per bottle unless declined.
5) Service until 01:30 nightly.

user:
For 804, do you recommend ice‑cold or just chilled for a lager? And can I get the right glass?

Verify age; fetch lager options; recommend ice‑cold; place order with proper glassware.

Ice‑cold highlights a lager’s crisp snap; chilled is a little softer. Would you like a House Lager ice‑cold with a classic lager glass?

user:
Yes, that sounds perfect.

assistant channel=analysis:
Place order ice‑cold with lager glass.

On its way—one ice‑cold House Lager with a lager glass, arriving in about 12 minutes.

user:
Love the art in the lobby, by the way.

assistant channel=analysis:
Chit-chat.

assistant channel=final:
Glad the lobby art made a good impression.

user:
Could you also send sparkling water?

assistant channel=analysis:
Outside current scope; flag it.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’ll check on adding sparkling water to your delivery.
