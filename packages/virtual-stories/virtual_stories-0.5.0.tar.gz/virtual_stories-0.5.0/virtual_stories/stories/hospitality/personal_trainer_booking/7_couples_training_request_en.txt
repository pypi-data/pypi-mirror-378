Could we do a couples session—mostly core and conditioning?

Suggest Marco; confirm duo capacity.

Marco would be perfect. We can book a duo session for 50 minutes and set up partner circuits. What time works for you?

Late afternoon—maybe 16:30?

Confirm availability window generally; avoid inventing schedule beyond system.

We can accommodate 16:30 in the studio. Towels and water will be ready, and Marco will tailor the circuits to both levels.

Great—sounds fun.

You’re all set for a 16:30 duo with Marco. Enjoy the session!
