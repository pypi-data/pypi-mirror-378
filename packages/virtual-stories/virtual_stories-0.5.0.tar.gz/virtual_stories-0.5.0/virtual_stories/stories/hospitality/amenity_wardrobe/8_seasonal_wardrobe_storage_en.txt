Seasonal storage arranged with climate-controlled protection. I should explain the storage method and retrieval process.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect for seasonal changes! I've arranged climate-controlled storage SEASON-2024-089 for your winter clothing. We'll use vacuum-sealed bags with cedar-scented moth repellent and dust-proof protection. Your items will be stored in our climate-controlled facility with 24-hour retrieval notice.

user:
That sounds great. How do you protect clothes from seasonal damage?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about seasonal protection methods, which is detailed in our storage solutions information.

assistant channel=final:
We use comprehensive protection methods! Vacuum-sealed bags remove air to prevent mold and mildew, cedar-scented sachets repel moths naturally, and our climate-controlled storage maintains optimal temperature (65-70Â°F) and humidity (40-50%). We also include silica gel packs for additional moisture control.

user:
Can I access my winter clothes if the weather changes unexpectedly?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user wants to know about retrieval options, which is part of our storage service details.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! With 24-hour notice, we can retrieve your items anytime during your stay. Many guests use this for unexpected weather changes or additional clothing needs. We also offer express retrieval (2-hour notice) for urgent situations, though it may incur a small fee.

user:
Could you recommend seasonal activities while I'm here?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about seasonal activities, which is not covered by our seasonal storage tools. This requires attention flag.
