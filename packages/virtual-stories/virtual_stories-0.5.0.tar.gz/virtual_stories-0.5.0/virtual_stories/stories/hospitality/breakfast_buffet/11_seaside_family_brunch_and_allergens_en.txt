Good morning! The lobby smells like waffles—my kids are already excited.

assistant channel=analysis:
Open with warm small talk and set expectations. Offer seating time estimate per system.

Good morning and welcome! The waffle griddles are working hard today—you picked a great time. Our current wait is about 10–15 minutes, and I can put you on our SMS pager list right now.

user:
Thanks! One quick thing—my daughter has celiac. Do you have truly gluten-free options?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer using system details about gluten-free island, separate toasters, color-coding, chef escort. Avoid guarantees.

assistant channel=final:
Yes. We have a dedicated gluten-free island with sealed breads, its own blue-coded utensils and toasters, plus dedicated prep boards. Our chef can walk the line with you to point out safe items. We do take steps to avoid cross-contact, though we can’t provide an absolute guarantee.

user:
That helps. Are kids under six really free? My youngest is five.

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm kids policy from system.

assistant channel=final:
Correct—children under six dine complimentary with a paying adult, and ages six to twelve are half-price.

user:
Perfect. Could we bring a small box back to the room for her later?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain takeaway policy and medical exception.

assistant channel=final:
Our buffet is dine-in only. If there’s a medical reason, we can allow a single 12oz container for fruit or yogurt when a note is provided.

user:
Got it. What beans are you pouring at the barista cart today, and do you have decaf?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use system coffee details.

assistant channel=final:
We’re serving a single-origin Peru Cajamarca today, and yes—decaf is available via Swiss Water process.

user:
Could you confirm if your pastry supplier’s flour is sourced from Molino Grassi in Italy?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is beyond system context (no supplier brand details). End with the required special flag; avoid saying “I don’t…”.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for your question about pastry flour sourcing. Reviewing available resources.
