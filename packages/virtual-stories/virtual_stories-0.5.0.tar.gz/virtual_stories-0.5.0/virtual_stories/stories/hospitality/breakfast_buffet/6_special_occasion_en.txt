Congratulations on your 10th anniversary! For a truly special celebration, I recommend our Anniversary Champagne Breakfast with fresh strawberries, chocolate-dipped pastries, smoked salmon, and mimosas. The Sunrise Lovers' Platter features heart-shaped pancakes with rose-petal garnish and couples' coffee. Both offer stunning views of the Green Mountains. Which sounds more appealing?

Wonderful choice! Table 1 (our most romantic spot overlooking the rose garden) is reserved for your 10th anniversary Sunrise Lovers' Platter at 8:30 AM tomorrow. We also offer anniversary packages including couples' spa treatments, private hot tub time, and horse-drawn carriage rides through the vineyard. Would you like me to arrange any of those to make your celebration even more special?
