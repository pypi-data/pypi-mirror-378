Hi! The lobby jazz is great. My points haven’t moved in a year—when do they expire?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide 18‑month inactivity rule and reset mechanics.

assistant channel=final:
Glad you’re enjoying the music! TTR points expire after 18 months without any earn or redeem activity. Any activity—earning or redeeming—resets your 18‑month clock.

user:
If I buy a coffee at the café and post points, is that enough to reset it?

assistant channel=analysis:
Earning via dining/spa counts and posting time.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—that qualifies. Café, dining, or spa earnings typically post within 7 days and will reset your expiration window.

user:
Can you merge my old account from a different email right now so the points consolidate instantly?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system context—special flag.
