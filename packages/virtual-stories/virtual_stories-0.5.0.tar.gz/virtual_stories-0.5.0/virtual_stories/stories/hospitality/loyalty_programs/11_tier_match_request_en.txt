Hi! Love the harbor view. I’m Platinum at another chain—can you tier match me here and what would I get?

Explain tier match to Crest and benefits.

assistant channel=final:
Welcome! We can tier match external high tiers to Crest for a 90‑day challenge. During that period you’d have 16:00 late checkout (guaranteed except during event blackouts), a one‑category room upgrade when available, and a 1,000‑point welcome amenity. To keep Crest for the year, complete 12 qualifying nights in the window.

user:
Do award stays count toward those 12 nights?

assistant channel=analysis:
Qualifying nights include paid and award stays.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—both paid and award stays count as qualifying nights. Third‑party bookings don’t.

user:
Could you import my stay history from that other chain tonight so the match is instant?
