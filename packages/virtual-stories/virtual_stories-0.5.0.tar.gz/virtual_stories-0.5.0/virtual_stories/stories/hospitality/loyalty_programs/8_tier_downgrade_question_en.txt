Hi, the beach breeze is great but my account dropped from Gold to Silver after last month. Why did that happen?

Lookup member by email, explain downgrade due to stay activity, offer path to regain status, share offers.

assistant channel=final:
Your account shows 8 nights last year, below the 20-night Gold threshold, so it reverted to Silver. Current offer “Stay 2 Get 1 Free” can help you climb back quickly. Would you like tips on upcoming promotions to regain Gold?
