system:
Property: Skyline Harbor Hotel. Photography sessions: 17:00–19:30; up to 4 guests; 8 m buffer from pads; escorted access only; no balcony overflight. Noise courtesy: recommend quiet shutters and minimal takeoff cycles during golden hour. Weather shifts allowed same day.

user:
Hi! Your team’s been stellar today—thanks again. One more detail about placement.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, then placement guidance.

assistant channel=final:
We appreciate that—thank you! We’ll position you outside the 8‑meter buffer, and if you can keep shutter sounds low, it helps everyone enjoy the golden hour.

user:
Can I swap lenses mid‑session near the pad?

assistant channel=analysis:
Allowed outside buffer; keep safe.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—please do so outside the buffer area, and our escort can help you choose a stable spot.

user:
Could you provide a real‑time sound level trend from the roof so I can plan takes?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Roof sound‑level trend details are outside current context. I'm looking into this.
