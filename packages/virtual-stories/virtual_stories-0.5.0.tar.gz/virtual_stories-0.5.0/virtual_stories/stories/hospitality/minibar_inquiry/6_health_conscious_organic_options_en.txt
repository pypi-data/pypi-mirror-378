Hi! I'm really excited to be here at your wellness retreat. I try to maintain a pretty strict organic and plant-based diet, even when I'm traveling, which can sometimes be challenging. I'm staying in a wellness suite and wondering what kind of healthy options you have in the minibar? I'm particularly interested in anything that's organic, vegan, and preferably low in added sugars. I've been on a wellness journey for the past year and don't want to derail my progress during this retreat!

How wonderful that you're committed to your wellness journey - that's exactly the kind of intentional living we celebrate here! Your wellness suite minibar is specially curated for guests like you. We have organic raw almonds ($12), which are perfect for protein and healthy fats, and superfood energy balls ($15) made with just dates, raw cacao, chia seeds, and coconut - completely vegan and naturally sweetened. The premium coconut water ($8) has no added sugars, and our kombucha selection ($10) supports gut health with live probiotics. Everything is USDA organic certified. Would you like me to check the detailed nutritional information on any specific items?

user:
Those superfood energy balls sound amazing! I love that they're made with just whole food ingredients. Could you tell me more about the nutritional breakdown of those? And the kombucha flavors sound intriguing - I'm particularly drawn to adaptogens lately, so the ashwagandha tea caught my eye too. Are there any other adaptogenic options available?

Great nutritional profile for the energy balls. Provide detailed information and address their interest in adaptogens.

assistant channel=final:
The superfood energy balls are nutritional powerhouses! Each serving of 3 balls has 180 calories, 6g of plant protein, 8g of fiber, and 9g of healthy fats from coconut and chia seeds. The 12g of natural sugars come entirely from Medjool dates - no added sweeteners. Plus you get omega-3s from chia and powerful antioxidants from raw cacao. For adaptogens, the ashwagandha tea is definitely a guest favorite for stress support, and we also have a turmeric blend for inflammation support. I can also check if our wellness market has additional adaptogenic supplements or snacks if you're looking to incorporate more into your routine here!

user:
