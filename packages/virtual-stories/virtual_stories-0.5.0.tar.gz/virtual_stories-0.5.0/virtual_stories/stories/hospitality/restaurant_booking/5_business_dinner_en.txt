Your business dinner is confirmed for Wednesday at 7 PM - reservation BUS-0821-06 with corporate billing set up for TechCorp Solutions. For impressing your client, I recommend our reserve Napa Cabernet or the elegant French Bordeaux from our premium collection. Both pair beautifully with our steak selections and convey sophistication. Our sommelier can guide you through the options when you arrive. I hope the meeting goes exceptionally well!
