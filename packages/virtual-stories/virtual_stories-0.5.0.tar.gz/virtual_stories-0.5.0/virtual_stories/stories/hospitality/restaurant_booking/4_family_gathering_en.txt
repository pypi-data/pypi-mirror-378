Hello! I'm planning a family reunion dinner for next Friday. We expect about 15 people including several children. Do you have space for a large group?

This is a large family gathering request. I should check availability for large groups and inquire about their specific needs for the family reunion.

Hello! A family reunion sounds lovely. We certainly have experience hosting large family gatherings here at Mountain View Lodge. Let me check our availability for 15 people next Friday. What time were you thinking, and do you have any special requirements for the children?

We're flexible on time - maybe around 6:30 PM? We have kids ranging from 3 to 12 years old, so we'd love if there were some activities or a kids' menu available.

Check availability for the requested time and party size, then share family-friendly options available.

Would you like me to book this for you?

That sounds wonderful! Please book it under the name Rodriguez. The kids will love the activities. By the way, do you have any recommendations for family activities in Aspen after dinner?

Your family reunion dinner is confirmed for Friday at 6:30 PM under Rodriguez - reservation FAM-0829-15. The kids will have a great time with our coloring activities and special menu. After dinner, I recommend the Aspen Family Fun Center just a 10-minute drive away - they have mini-golf, arcade games, and ice cream that the whole family enjoys. Our free shuttle can take you there if you'd like. We look forward to hosting your reunion!
