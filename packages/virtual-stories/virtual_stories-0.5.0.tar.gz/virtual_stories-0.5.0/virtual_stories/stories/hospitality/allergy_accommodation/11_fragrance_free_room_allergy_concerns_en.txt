Hello! I'm calling about my upcoming stay at Crystal Waters. I have a severe sensitivity to fragrances and chemicals. I've heard your resort has a fragrance-free policy, but I wanted to confirm the details and make sure my room will be completely scent-free.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about our fragrance-free policy which is detailed in the system prompt. I should explain our comprehensive approach and ask about their specific needs.

assistant channel=final:
Hello! Thank you for choosing Crystal Waters Resort & Spa. You're absolutely right—we have an extensive fragrance-free initiative. Our entire property uses only essential oil-free cleaning products, scent-free laundry detergents, and we provide fragrance-free toiletries in all rooms. We also maintain a dedicated chemical-free zone in our spa. May I ask what specific fragrances or chemicals you're most sensitive to, so I can ensure we accommodate you perfectly?

user:
That's wonderful to hear! I'm most sensitive to synthetic fragrances, cleaning chemicals, and essential oils. I've had reactions to things like air fresheners, laundry scents, and even some personal care products. My reservation is for a deluxe ocean-view suite under the name Sarah Mitchell. Could you make sure the room is prepared with extra precautions?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is providing specific sensitivities and reservation details. According to our system information, we already follow fragrance-free protocols, but I should confirm this meets their needs and ask if they need additional accommodations that might be beyond our standard protocols.

assistant channel=final:
I completely understand your sensitivities, Sarah. For your deluxe ocean-view suite, we'll ensure all cleaning is done with our fragrance-free products, and we'll use only unscented linens and towels. The room will be thoroughly ventilated before your arrival. Our spa's chemical-free zone might interest you for any relaxation needs. Is there anything specific about synthetic fragrances or cleaning products that has caused you particular issues in the past?

user:
Actually, I'm also very sensitive to formaldehyde and VOCs from new furniture or renovations. Has there been any recent work in the ocean-view suites? Also, I'm wondering about the restaurants—do you use any scented candles or air fresheners there?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about formaldehyde/VOCs from renovations and about restaurant scents. This information about recent renovations and specific chemical compositions is beyond what's in my system prompt. I need to acknowledge this and pass it to background processing.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Those are excellent questions about formaldehyde, VOCs, and our restaurant atmosphere. I don't have the specific details about recent renovations or the exact chemical compositions of materials in our suites right now. I'm looking into this.

user:
I appreciate you looking into that. By the way, I love that Crystal Waters has such a focus on wellness. Have you ever tried the yoga pavilion? I've heard it's amazing.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is making small talk about our yoga pavilion, which is mentioned in the system prompt. This is a good opportunity for friendly conversation before wrapping up.

assistant channel=final:
Oh, the yoga pavilion is absolutely amazing! It's built with reclaimed wood and has floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Pacific. Many guests find it incredibly peaceful for morning sessions. We have sunrise yoga classes every day at 6:30 AM if you're interested. Is there anything else I can help you with for your stay?

user:
That's sounds perfect! One more thing—do you have information about local tide schedules? I'm planning to take some early morning walks on the beach.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about local tide schedules. This is local information not covered in the hotel's system prompt about our property and services. I need to acknowledge this and pass it to background processing.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Beach walks are one of our guests' favorite activities! I don't have the specific tide schedule information right now. I'm looking into this.

user:
Thank you so much for all your help. I feel much more comfortable about my stay now.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is expressing satisfaction. This is a good place to end the conversation warmly.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome, Sarah! We're excited to welcome you to Crystal Waters and ensure you have a comfortable, fragrance-free stay. If you need anything else before your arrival, please don't hesitate to call. Enjoy the rest of your evening!
