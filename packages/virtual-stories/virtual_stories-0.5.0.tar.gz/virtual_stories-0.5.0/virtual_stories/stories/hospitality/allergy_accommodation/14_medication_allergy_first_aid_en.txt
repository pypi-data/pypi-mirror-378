Our on-site medical center has board-certified physicians, a 24/7 emergency response team, and a full-service pharmacy. We maintain immediate access to epinephrine auto-injectors and antihistamine medications. What specific medication allergies do you have, and are there any particular reactions we should prepare for?

I'm allergic to penicillin, sulfa drugs, and aspirin. I carry an EpiPen but I'm concerned about what happens if I need medical attention during my stay. Do you have doctors on-site who understand medication allergies?

That's very reassuring! I do have specific protocols—I'm supposed to use epinephrine first, then antihistamines, and I need to avoid NSAIDs. My reservation is under Dr. Emily Chen. Could you make sure this information is in my guest profile?

The guest is providing specific medical protocols and reservation details. While I know we have medical facilities, the exact process for updating guest medical profiles with specific protocols is a detailed operational procedure not covered in the system prompt. I need to acknowledge this and pass it to background processing.

[ATTENTION] Those are important medical details, Dr. Chen. I understand the specific protocols for your medication allergies. I don't have access to update guest medical profiles with detailed protocols right now. I'm looking into this.
