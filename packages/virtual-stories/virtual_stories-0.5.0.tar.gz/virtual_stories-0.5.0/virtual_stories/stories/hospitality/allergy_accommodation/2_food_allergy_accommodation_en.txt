I've arranged for a specialized nut-free deep cleaning of your room and notified our kitchen staff about your severe allergies to nuts, shellfish, and dairy. Our chef will prepare your meals in our dedicated allergy-safe kitchen area. Would you like me to arrange a consultation with our nutritionist about menu options?
