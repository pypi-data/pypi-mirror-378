Good afternoon! I'm staying in the Garden Villa and would love to try some of your facial masks. My skin has been feeling really dry lately from all the travel.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect timing for some skincare TLC! Based on your dry skin concerns, I recommend our hydrating masks with hyaluronic acid and rose water, or our calming masks with chamomile and our property's organic honey. Both are excellent for travel-stressed skin. Which room number should I deliver to?

This sounds incredibly relaxing! I've never used a facial roller before. Is it difficult to use?

Guest asking about facial roller technique. This is general skincare advice that's included in our application guide, but not requiring tools.

Not at all! The rose quartz roller is very intuitive—just gentle upward and outward strokes from the center of your face. The application guide includes detailed techniques, and our spa consultant can demonstrate during delivery if you'd like.

user:
