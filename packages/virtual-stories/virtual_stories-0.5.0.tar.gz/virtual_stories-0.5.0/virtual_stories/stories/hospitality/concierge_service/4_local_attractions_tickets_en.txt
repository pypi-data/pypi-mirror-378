That sounds great! Is there a good way to get between them?

Provide transportation recommendations based on local knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
Yes! You can take a cable car from Union Square to the Bridge (about 20 minutes), and then BART from the Bridge area to the museum (about 15 minutes). I can arrange discounted transit passes if you'd like.

user:
That would be helpful, thank you.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge transportation request - this is chitchat/small talk.

I'll have discounted transit passes ready for you at the front desk. Your attraction tickets will also be waiting there. If you need any other recommendations or assistance during your exploration, don't hesitate to ask. Have a fantastic day in San Francisco! ðŸŒ‰
