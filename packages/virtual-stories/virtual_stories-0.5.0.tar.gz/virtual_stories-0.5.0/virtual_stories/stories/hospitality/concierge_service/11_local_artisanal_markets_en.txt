The breeze here is wonderful! Guests love exploring the small artisan stalls along Ocean Blvd and the weekend pop-ups near the marina. Start with the promenade by the pier, then head a few blocks inland for boutique workshops. If you plan a beach stop after, we have beach towels at the pool desk and loaner umbrellas, and there are partner discounts at two nearby surf shops.
