That's great timing. Your hotel's location near the canals is perfect for cycling.

What's the best time to cycle around the canals without crowds?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about optimal cycling times. This information isn't in our system context about the hotel facilities, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.
