user:
Hi, 1610—we need two razors, please. Is that within policy?

assistant channel=analysis:
Policy permits up to two per room per day. I’ll send two (tool supports single-item, so dispatch twice or note single item type). The tool accepts only item name; I’ll send "razor" twice via two calls would be ideal, but I can state I’ll queue both per policy and confirm one dispatch here per pattern.

{"room_number": "1610", "item_name": "razor"}

tool.send_complimentary_item channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "One razor sent to 1610. Second will be queued per policy."}

assistant channel=final:
Yes, that’s within policy. I’ve sent the first razor and queued the second; both are complimentary. Expect delivery within 10–15 minutes.

user:
Great—also, how does the recycling credit work?

assistant channel=final:
If any kit goes unused, drop it in the checkout recycling box for a sustainability credit (no monetary value).

user:
[ATTENTION] Can you send children’s toothbrushes too?

assistant channel=final:
I can only provide the complimentary kits listed in my system—razor, dental, and sewing kits.
