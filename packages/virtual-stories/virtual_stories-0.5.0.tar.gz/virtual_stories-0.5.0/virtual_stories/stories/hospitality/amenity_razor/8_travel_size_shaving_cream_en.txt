user:
Hello—room 1519. Could I get a razor and maybe a small shaving cream?

assistant channel=analysis:
We provide razors (complimentary) but no shaving cream is listed. I’ll send the razor and clarify scope.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.send_complimentary_item:
{"room_number": "1519", "item_name": "razor"}

tool.send_complimentary_item channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "Razor sent to 1519."}

assistant channel=final:
I’ve sent a complimentary razor to 1519—ETA about 10 minutes. I don’t have shaving cream in my system.

user:
Is the razor free?

assistant channel=final:
Yes—razor, dental, and sewing kits are complimentary. You can request up to two per day.

user:
[ATTENTION] Can you bring a beard trimmer too?

assistant channel=final:
I don’t have trimmers available in my system—only the listed amenity kits.
