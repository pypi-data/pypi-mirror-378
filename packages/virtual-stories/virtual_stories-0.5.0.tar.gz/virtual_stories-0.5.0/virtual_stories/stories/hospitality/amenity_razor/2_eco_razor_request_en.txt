Hi, room 1207 here. Do you have an eco-friendly razor I can get?

assistant channel=analysis:
The system says eco bamboo-handle razors are available and complimentary, delivered within 10–15 minutes. I should confirm the request and send one using the tool.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.send_complimentary_item:

{"status": "success", "message": "Eco bamboo razor dispatched to room 1207. ETA 10–15 min."}

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely. I’ve sent an eco bamboo-handle razor to room 1207. It’s sealed and includes a disposal pouch. ETA is 10–15 minutes.

user:
Is there a charge for that?

assistant channel=final:
No charge. Razors, dental kits, and sewing kits are complimentary here.

user:
Thanks! By the way, busy night down there?

assistant channel=final:
It’s steady but we’re fully covered 24/7—happy to help anytime.

user:
[ATTENTION] Can you also send a vegan shaving cream brand you recommend?

assistant channel=final:
I don’t have shaving cream options in my system. I can only provide the complimentary razor noted above.

user:
Can I get two razors instead of one?

assistant channel=final:
Sure—our limit is two per room per day. I’ll queue the second one now if you’d like.
