That sounds perfect! I'm particularly interested in the demerara sugar. What's the flavor profile like for rum cocktails?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the flavor profile of demerara sugar for rum cocktails. From our system prompt, I know we have demerara sugar for classic rum cocktails and tiki drinks, and I should provide details about its characteristics for professional mixology use.

assistant channel=final:
Our demerara sugar has a rich, complex flavor profile that's absolutely perfect for rum cocktails! It has a deep caramel note with subtle molasses undertones that complement the natural sweetness of rum. The large crystals dissolve slowly, allowing you to control the sweetness level and create layered flavors. It's particularly excellent in classic tiki drinks like Mai Tais and Zombies, where the caramel notes enhance the tropical flavors. The sugar is sourced from Guyana and maintains its traditional processing methods for authentic flavor.
