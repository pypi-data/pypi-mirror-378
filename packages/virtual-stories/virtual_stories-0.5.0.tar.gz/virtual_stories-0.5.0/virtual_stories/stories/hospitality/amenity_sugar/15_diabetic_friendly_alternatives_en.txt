Our monk fruit sweetener has an extremely low glycemic index, making it excellent for blood sugar management! It's naturally sweet without any impact on blood glucose levels, and it's derived from the monk fruit which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. The sweetener is 150-200 times sweeter than sugar, so you only need a tiny amount. It's also free from calories and carbohydrates, making it perfect for diabetic-friendly beverages and recipes.
