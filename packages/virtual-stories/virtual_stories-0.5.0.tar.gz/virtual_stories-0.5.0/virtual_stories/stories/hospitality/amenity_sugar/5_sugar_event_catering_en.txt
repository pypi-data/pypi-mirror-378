Hello! I'm hosting a client presentation in my suite tomorrow and need about 50 sugar packets for the coffee service. Could you arrange that?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is hosting a client presentation and needs bulk sugar for coffee service. I should use the event_use flag and request a substantial quantity for professional presentation needs.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "sugar", "quantity": 50, "event_use": true}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "Bulk sugar supply for event use delivered to your executive suite with professional serving trays."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I should mention our catering services and executive facilities available in the system prompt since this is a business event.

assistant channel=final:
Certainly! I've arranged for 50 sugar packets to be delivered to your suite with professional serving trays. We also offer catering services with customizable coffee stations if you'd like to elevate your client presentation. Our executive conference rooms are available if you need additional space.

user:
That's excellent! The serving trays will be perfect. How much do the conference rooms cost?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about conference room costs. This information is not available in the system prompt - we only mention executive conference rooms but no pricing details. This requires the ATTENTION flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Our conference rooms are very popular for presentations! Checking current pricing and availability.
