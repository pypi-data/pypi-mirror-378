system:
Seabreeze Hotel – Garage clearance: 2.1 m. Oversized vehicles may require curbside permit for temporary drop-off; residential quiet hours 22:00–07:00. Valet ticketing available curbside; key retained for moves. No roof cargo allowed inside garage if height exceeds limit.

user:
My SUV with a roof box is pretty tall—can you take it?

assistant channel=analysis:
State clearance 2.1 m; suggest curbside option.

assistant channel=final:
Our garage clearance is 2.1 m. With a roof box, it may exceed that, so we can process curbside valet ticketing and coordinate alternate surface parking. Will you be unloading luggage right away, or shall we stage a cart?

user:
Can the roof box be stored separately?

assistant channel=analysis:
No roof cargo in garage if exceeds limit; storage not listed.

assistant channel=final:
We can't accept roof cargo in the garage if it exceeds clearance at entry. Unloading assistance is available at the curb, and the vehicle can be secured in suitable parking.

user:
Could you share the city’s temporary curb permit issuance system API docs?

assistant channel=analysis:
External docs; flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Gathering relevant data on the curb permit API documentation.
