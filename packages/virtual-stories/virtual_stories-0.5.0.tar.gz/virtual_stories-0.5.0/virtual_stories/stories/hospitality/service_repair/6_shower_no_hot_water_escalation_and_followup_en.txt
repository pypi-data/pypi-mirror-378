There’s no hot water in 514. How quickly can this be fixed, and do you follow up?

Open a high-priority ticket; assign engineer with ETA; confirm we follow up after closure.

I’ve opened ticket TVL-ENG-404 as high priority; Engineer Patel will arrive in about 12 minutes. If temperature is still below standard after the fix, we escalate to our boiler tech, and the front desk will follow up once the ticket is closed.

The river looks calm.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a peaceful stretch by this time.

Can you share the boiler’s full service contract?
