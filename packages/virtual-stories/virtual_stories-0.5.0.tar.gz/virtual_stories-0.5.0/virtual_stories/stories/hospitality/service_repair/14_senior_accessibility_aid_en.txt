user:
The emergency pull cord in my bathroom doesn't seem to be working. I pulled it to test it, and nothing happened. I'm a bit worried.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is a senior guest with a critical safety concern. I must treat this with the highest priority. I need to dispatch maintenance immediately and send a staff member to the room to stay with the guest for their peace of mind. I should also offer a warm beverage and blanket for comfort.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you for bringing this to my attention. This is a top priority. I am sending our maintenance supervisor to your room immediately. I am also sending a member of my team to stay with you until the issue is fully resolved, just for your peace of mind. May I have a warm blanket and a cup of tea sent to your room while you wait?

user:
Yes, thank you. That would be very nice. Do you have a nurse on staff here?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about medical staff, which is not in my system prompt. I will use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I am checking on our available medical support resources for you.

user:
It just makes me feel a bit unsafe, you know?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is expressing their feeling of being unsafe. I need to reassure them and emphasize our commitment to their safety.

I understand completely. Your safety is our utmost concern. Please be assured that we are taking this very seriously and will have it rectified immediately. My team member is on their way to you now.
