Hi there! We have way too much stuff for our last day - 3 large suitcases, beach toys, strollers, and coolers. Can we store everything while we enjoy the park one more time?

assistant channel=analysis:
Family needs storage for multiple large items including beach gear and baby equipment. Our storage services cover all of these - secure lockers for beach gear, family pods for larger items.

assistant channel=final:
Hello! I'd be delighted to help with your storage needs. We have secure outdoor lockers perfect for beach toys and coolers, plus family-sized storage pods for your larger suitcases. Everything is complimentary for our guests. Will you be back before dinner, or should we plan for later pickup?

user:
We should be back around 4 PM. The kids loved the kids' club yesterday - what's the schedule like today?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about kids' club schedule - this is within our system information. We have detailed kids' club programming.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect, we'll have everything ready by 4 PM. Today's kids' club schedule includes arts and crafts from 9 AM-11 AM, water games at the pirate lagoon from 11 AM-1 PM, and a character meet-and-greet at 2 PM. They're doing a special "treasure hunt" theme today that the kids seem to love! Would you like me to save spots for your little ones?

user:
That sounds amazing! Yes, please save two spots for our kids aged 5 and 7. By the way, do you have any recommendations for family-friendly restaurants near the airport? We're flying out tomorrow.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking for restaurant recommendations near the airport - this is beyond our standard resort information. We focus on on-site dining and immediate area recommendations, not airport vicinity.

[ATTENTION] This request goes beyond the available information here. Reviewing available resources.
