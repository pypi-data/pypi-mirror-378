Hi! I'm in room 418 and I have pretty severe dust mite allergies. The bed seems comfortable but I'm worried about allergens. Do you have mattress protectors that could help?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest in room 418 has dust mite allergies, needs allergen protection. Check dust mite protector options first, then check broader allergy accommodations.
