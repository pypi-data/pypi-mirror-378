Hello! I’m coordinating six presenters for a two‑day academic workshop. Do your meeting rooms support classroom seating with big displays?

assistant channel=analysis:
Meeting space capacities and displays are in system. Chartroom fits classroom with dual 75" displays.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the Chartroom supports up to 20 in classroom style and features dual 75" displays. Day‑use is 08:00–21:00 with a $150 setup fee. The Wharf Boardroom seats 8 with a single 65" display if you need a breakout.

user:
Perfect. Could we reserve the Chartroom 09:00–15:00 both days, and two City Kings plus one Corner King for presenters?

assistant channel=analysis:
Can acknowledge typical process without tools; confirm we can tentatively hold space and rooms pending deposit.

assistant channel=final:
I can place a tentative hold for the Chartroom 09:00–15:00 across both days and set aside two City Kings and one Corner King. We’ll need a signed agreement and a deposit for the meeting space to confirm. Shall I prepare the documents under your university name?

user:
Thanks. Also, is garage parking available and do you have EV charging?

assistant channel=analysis:
Parking details: $18/night; two J1772 chargers included with parking.

assistant channel=final:
Garage parking is available at $18 per night. We have two J1772 EV chargers, included with parking—first‑come, first‑served.

user:
By the way, do you have a printer guests can use for handouts?

assistant channel=analysis:
Not specified; system has no business center. Provide in-room desk info; gently note lack of printer info.

assistant channel=final:
We do not list a guest printer, but all rooms include desks with task lamps and hotel Wi‑Fi at 150 Mbps. If you need printed handouts, I can check on local options. Would you like me to look into nearby print shops?

user:
Yes, please share the nearest shop’s current prices for 100 color pages.

assistant channel=analysis:
External vendor pricing is beyond system context and we have no tools. Use special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you’d like current pricing from a nearby print shop. Searching for more information.
