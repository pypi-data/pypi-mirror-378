Hi—room 405. Can you set the purifier to the quietest mode for a 90-minute nap? Also, can the lights on it be dimmed?

assistant channel=analysis:
Sleep mode with 90 minutes fits; LED dimming behavior stated in system.

assistant channel=final:
Done—405 is in sleep mode for 90 minutes. In sleep mode, indicator lights dim automatically here.

user:
Appreciate it! The kid’s room earlier was a lifesaver.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk from system context.

assistant channel=final:
Glad it helped—our kid’s activity room runs 10:00 to 18:00.

user:
Can you also provide a humidifier?

assistant channel=analysis:
Outside the provided scope.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I can check on humidifier availability.
