user:
Perfect. What's the best brush for wool suits versus cotton shirts?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide specific fabric care guidance from system knowledge about different brush types for wool suits and cotton shirts.

assistant channel=final:
For wool suits, use the German boar-bristle brush - it's designed for structured garments and removes lint while maintaining the fabric's integrity. For cotton dress shirts, the Italian horsehair brush is ideal as it's gentler on cotton fibers and won't cause pilling.

user:

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge the city view compliment, referencing the panoramic views mentioned in design notes.

assistant channel=final:
