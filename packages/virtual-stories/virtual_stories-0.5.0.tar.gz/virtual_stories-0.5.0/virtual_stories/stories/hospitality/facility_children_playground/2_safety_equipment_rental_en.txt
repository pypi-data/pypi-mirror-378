Hi! The playground looks amazing but quite challenging. Do you rent safety equipment for kids? My twins are 8 years old.

Absolutely! We rent helmets, knee pads, and elbow pads specifically for the challenging areas. For your twins, we have equipment sets available with mandatory fitting appointments and safety briefings before use. What's your guest ID so I can complete the rental?

Great! Guest ID MV-556. They're pretty adventurous but I worry about the higher climbing structures.
