system:
Rooms use a ControlTab A8 tablet for lights, blinds, thermostat, and casting PIN. Quick reset: hold power + volume up for 8 seconds, then select “Reboot.” App relaunches within 60 seconds and reattaches to the room profile. Privacy wipe runs at checkout, clearing session data and PIN history. If the tablet won’t pair, toggle Bluetooth and Wi‑Fi off/on within the tablet settings, then relaunch the Room Controls app. Spare units are kept at the service closet on each even floor. Quiet hours 22:00–07:00; non-urgent swaps are scheduled daytime.

user:
Hi! The tablet froze on the blinds page. The view at dusk is gorgeous though.

assistant channel=final:
It really is—our harbor sunsets are special. Let’s bring the tablet back: press and hold power + volume up for 8 seconds, then choose “Reboot.”

user:
It restarted. Room Controls opened, but the blinds slider is laggy.

assistant channel=analysis:
Suggest toggle radios and relaunch app.

assistant channel=final:
Please open Settings and toggle Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth off, wait five seconds, then back on. Next, relaunch the Room Controls app.

user:
That did it. Does this clear my data when I check out?

assistant channel=analysis:
Privacy wipe at checkout clears sessions and PIN history.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—at checkout the tablet runs a privacy wipe that clears session data and your casting PIN history.

user:
Could you install a third‑party blinds app so I can script sunrise?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Custom app installation isn’t part of our supported tablet profile. I’m forwarding this for background consideration.
