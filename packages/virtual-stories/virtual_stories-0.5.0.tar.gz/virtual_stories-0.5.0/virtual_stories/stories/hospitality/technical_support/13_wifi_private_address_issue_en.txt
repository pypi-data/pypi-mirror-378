Hotel Wi‑Fi: "HG-Guest" (5 GHz preferred) with captive portal; room devices should stay on same VLAN for casting and tablet control. Access points are per wing and floor: e.g., AP-11E (east), AP-11W (west). For sticky roaming issues, forgetting the network and reconnecting helps. Private MAC/Private Address on some devices can break session persistence; disabling it for "HG-Guest" stabilizes sessions. Ethernet is available at the desk port in suites only. Tech desk can provide a short CAT6 to suites. Quiet hours for in-room visits: 22:00–07:00.

user:
Hello! The lounge playlist is great today. My laptop keeps dropping off HG-Guest.

assistant channel=final:
Glad you’re enjoying it. Let’s stabilize the link—please forget "HG-Guest" and reconnect, then ensure Private MAC/Private Address is disabled for this network.

user:
Done. Still seeing drops when I move toward the window.

assistant channel=analysis:
Suggest staying closer to the room AP side; identify wing AP.

assistant channel=final:
You’re likely closer to AP-11E by the hallway. Try working nearer the door side of the room for a stronger 5 GHz signal. If you’re in a suite, we can loan a CAT6 cable for wired access.

user:
Could you boost the AP power for my room only?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Radio power changes per-room aren’t part of our guest-side controls. I’m flagging your request for targeted review.
