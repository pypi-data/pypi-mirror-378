While you're looking into that, could you tell me about your hydrotherapy pools? I've heard they're therapeutic.

Our hydrotherapy pools are indeed therapeutic! They feature mineral-infused waters with magnesium, calcium, and trace minerals from local hot springs. The temperature is maintained at 98Â°F for optimal relaxation, and the minerals help with muscle tension, joint health, and stress reduction.

The pools are available from 7 AM to 9 PM, with dedicated family hours in the morning. We provide flotation devices and have a wellness guide available to explain the therapeutic benefits.
