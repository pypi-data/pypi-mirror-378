Hello, I have a 45-page document I need to fax to my office. Can you help me with that?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest needs to fax a large 45-page document. I should check fax limitations and provide cost information from system prompt about bulk fax services.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! Our high-volume fax machine can handle up to 100 pages per transmission, so 45 pages is well within our capacity. We offer domestic fax at $2.00 per page, and there's a 10% discount for 20+ pages. Would this be a domestic or international fax?

user:
It's domestic. That discount sounds good! How does the bulk discount work exactly?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about the bulk discount details which are specified in the system prompt as 10% off for 20+ pages.

assistant channel=final:
The bulk discount applies to transmissions of 20 pages or more - you get 10% off the regular $2.00 per page rate. For your 45-page document, that would be $2.00 × 45 = $90, minus 10% discount = $81 total. We can process this immediately at the business center.

user:
Great! And can you bind or prepare the document for me?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about document preparation services which are mentioned in the system prompt as available (stapling, paper clips).

assistant channel=final:
Yes, we offer document preparation services including stapling and paper clips to keep your pages organized. Our business assistant can help prepare your document for faxing if needed. The service is complimentary for fax customers.

user:
Perfect. One more question - do you provide fax confirmation?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about fax confirmation which is mentioned in the system prompt as available (fax confirmation receipts).

assistant channel=final:
Yes, we provide fax confirmation receipts that show successful transmission, including date, time, and recipient confirmation. This is included with every fax service at no additional charge.
