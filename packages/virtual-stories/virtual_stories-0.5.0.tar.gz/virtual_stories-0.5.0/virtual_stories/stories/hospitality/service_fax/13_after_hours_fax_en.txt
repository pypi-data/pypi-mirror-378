Hi, it's 11:30 PM and I urgently need to send a fax. Is your fax service still available?

Yes, we have 24/7 fax service available! During after-hours, we offer emergency fax service at $15 per page (minimum 3 pages) with a 30-minute service guarantee. Self-service fax machines are also available in our 24/7 business center if you'd prefer to handle it yourself.

The emergency service sounds perfect. I have 5 pages to send. How does that work?

For emergency service, bring your documents to the front desk and our night staff will process them immediately. At $15 per page for 5 pages, that would be $75 total. We guarantee 30-minute processing and will provide delivery confirmation. The service is available for both domestic and international destinations.

Excellent. What about international faxes after hours?
