Can you scan A2 blueprints?

assistant channel=analysis:
System states ADF letter/A4 only—decline politely.

assistant channel=final:
We’re limited to letter/A4 sizes and can’t scan A2 blueprints here.

user:
Could you still scan the folded index at least?

assistant channel=analysis:
If folded to A4, we can scan; answer from system capability.

assistant channel=final:
If you fold a section down to A4 size, we can scan that portion to PDF with OCR.

user:
[ATTENTION] About how long would 1 folded page take right now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use the estimate_turnaround tool with pages=1 to avoid guessing.
