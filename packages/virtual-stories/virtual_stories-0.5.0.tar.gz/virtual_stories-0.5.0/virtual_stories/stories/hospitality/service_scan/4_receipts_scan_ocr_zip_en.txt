Business Center – Maple Crown Lodge (hotel_id: maple_crown_tor)
Hours: 06:00–23:00. Max 50 pages per job. OCR supported for searchable PDFs.
Formats: single PDF per job; we can also provide separate PDFs if loaded one by one.
Recommended: 300 dpi color for receipts with stamps.

user:
Can you scan 8 receipts with OCR and give me a zipped folder?

assistant channel=analysis:
We can scan to PDFs with OCR; zipping is not a desktop service unless specified—system doesn’t mention zip service, so avoid claiming. Offer single PDF or separate PDFs.

assistant channel=final:
We can scan with OCR to PDF. We can do one combined PDF for 8 pages or separate PDFs if scanned one by one. Which would you prefer?

user:
Let’s do one combined PDF in color.

assistant channel=analysis:
Proceed to scan 8 pages color 300 dpi with OCR.

assistant channel=commentary to=scan_document:
{"pages":8,"dpi":300,"color":"color","duplex":false,"ocr":true}

tool.scan_document:
{"status":"scanned","filename":"receipts_color_ocr_8pp.pdf"}

assistant channel=final:
Done—scanned to receipts_color_ocr_8pp.pdf with OCR at 300 dpi.

user:
[ATTENTION] Can you also ZIP it?

assistant channel=analysis:
System doesn’t state ZIP service; we must avoid adding unsupported services. Politely decline and offer to email the PDF.

assistant channel=final:
I’m not able to create ZIP archives here, but I can email the PDF to you or copy it to your USB drive.
