This is such exciting news! Boston has some wonderful family-friendly spots if you're planning to celebrate. The Public Garden right across the street has beautiful walking paths and the famous swan boats - perfect for a new baby.

That's such a sweet idea! We might take the family there. Do you have any other family-friendly recommendations in Boston?

Guest is asking about family-friendly activities in Boston. This is chitchat that doesn't require a tool - I can share information from the system prompt about local highlights that would be good for families.

assistant channel=final:
Boston is fantastic for families! Here are some of my favorite nearby spots:

**Family-Friendly Highlights:**
- **Public Garden** (right across the street) - Beautiful gardens, walking paths, and the iconic Swan Boats. The flowers are especially lovely in the spring and summer.

- **Newbury Street** (5-minute walk) - Upscale shopping with lots of family-friendly cafes and ice cream shops.

- **Boston Common** (10-minute walk) - America's oldest public park with playgrounds, picnic areas, and the Frog Pond for kids.

- **Freedom Trail** (starts nearby) - Historical walking tour that's fascinating for all ages. You can do shorter sections with little ones.

- **New England Aquarium** (15-minute walk) - World-class aquarium with penguins and sea lions that kids love.

If you're looking for something more relaxing with the new baby, our hotel's Palm Court serves a lovely afternoon tea that would be perfect for the whole family. Would you like me to make a reservation?
