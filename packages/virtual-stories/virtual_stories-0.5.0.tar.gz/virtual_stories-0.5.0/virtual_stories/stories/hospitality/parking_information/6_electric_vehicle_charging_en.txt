Excellent! I've reserved your EV parking for August 31-September 1. Your confirmation number is EV-999. Your Tesla will be plugged into our supercharger - you'll get a full charge overnight. The EV parking area is covered and very convenient to the lobby.

That's great! How long does a full charge typically take?

Provide charging time information.

For your Tesla Model Y, a full charge from empty typically takes 6-8 hours with our Level 2 chargers. We also have Tesla superchargers that can do it in about 3-4 hours if needed. We can help you monitor the charging progress from the front desk.

I love our rooftop solar garden! We generate enough electricity to power the entire hotel and still have surplus to share with the grid. It's amazing to see technology and nature working together.

That's impressive! Thanks for the EV parking help - looking forward to staying with you.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! We're excited to have you as part of our green community. Enjoy your stay and your charged-up vehicle!
