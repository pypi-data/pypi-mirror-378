Hi there! The lobby scent is calming—cedar, right? We’re a family of three; can we get a third key?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm scent small talk; explain manager override needed for a third key.

assistant channel=final:
You’ve got a good nose—it’s a cedar blend. We can issue two active keys by default; a third would need a quick manager override once we verify all three IDs on the reservation.

user:
Also, we forgot our safe PIN. Can you reset it?

assistant channel=analysis:
Safe PIN reset with ID verification.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—bring an ID and we’ll reset the in‑room safe PIN right away.

user:
Could you send the full safe lock service logs for our room for the past year?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond facts—use flag.
