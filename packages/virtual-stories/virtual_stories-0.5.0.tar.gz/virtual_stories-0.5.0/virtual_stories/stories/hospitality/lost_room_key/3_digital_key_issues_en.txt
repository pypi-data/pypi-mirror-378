I can help with that! The issue is that your hotel app needs to be updated to the latest version. Please go to your app store and update the TechSavvy Hotel app - it should only take about 5 minutes. Once updated, your digital key should work perfectly.

Okay, I just updated the app. Let me try the door again... hmm, it's still not working.
