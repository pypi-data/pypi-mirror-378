Hello! Check‑in was smooth, thank you. For our group, can you brief everyone on key safety when they pick up their cards?

Affirm and restate key policies.

We’re glad the arrival was easy. We’ll brief each verified guest: keep cards separate from room numbers, and if a card is misplaced we re‑key immediately and invalidate prior tokens. Keys are issued only to guests listed on the reservation with ID.

If a card goes missing at 2 AM, how fast can you re‑key?

Re‑key is immediate on report.

Right away—once you contact us, we invalidate the lost token and issue a new card on ID verification.
