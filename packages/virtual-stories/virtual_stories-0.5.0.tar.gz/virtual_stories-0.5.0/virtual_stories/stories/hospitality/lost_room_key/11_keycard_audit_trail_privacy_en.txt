user:
Hi, I think I dropped my keycard near the coffee kiosk. Also, I love the scent in the lobby—what is it?

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge; small talk about scent; outline re-key process.

assistant channel=final:
No worries—we’ll re-key your room right away. The lobby scent is our "Citrus Cedar" blend. Please bring an ID to the Front Desk and we’ll issue a fresh card; the lost one will be invalidated.

user:
Can you tell me exactly which timestamps my door was opened today and by which card UID?

assistant channel=analysis:
Policy says raw logs aren’t shared; provide re-key confirmation availability.

assistant channel=final:
For privacy and security, we don’t release raw door access logs. I can confirm the re-key time and that prior tokens were disabled, and arrange a Security consult if needed.

user:
I want a copy of the complete audit trail for legal review, including staff entries for housekeeping.

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond available facts; use the special flag and conclude.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Evaluating potential solutions for formal audit-trail request through Security review workflow.
