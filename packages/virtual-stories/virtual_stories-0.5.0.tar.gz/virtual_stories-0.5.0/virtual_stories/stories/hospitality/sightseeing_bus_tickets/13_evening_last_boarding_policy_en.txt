user:
Hello! The lobby smells like fresh citrus—new diffuser?

assistant channel=final:
You’ve got a good nose—we refreshed the lobby scent this morning. How can I help with your evening plans?

user:
If we hop on the Green Loop around 19:20, will we still be allowed to board here?

assistant channel=analysis:
Green last boarding at G17 is 19:30; 19:20 is okay.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—boarding at 19:20 at Stop G17 is within the last‑boarding window. The final boarding from this stop is 19:30.

user:
And if we haven’t activated yet, could we refund later tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Refunds allowed before activation only, minus $5 per ticket; tonight still okay if unscanned.

assistant channel=final:
If your QR wristbands remain unscanned, we can process a refund tonight with a $5 processing fee per ticket. After first scan, refunds aren’t available.

user:
Is there a special event route extension to the Stadium after 20:00 tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
No such info in system; beyond context—use flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for checking—that extension isn’t listed in our current route information. Assessing the available data.
