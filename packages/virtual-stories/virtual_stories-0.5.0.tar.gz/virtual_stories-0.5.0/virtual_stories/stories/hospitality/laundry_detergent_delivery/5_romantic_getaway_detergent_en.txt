How romantic - an anniversary weekend at Rosewood! I've arranged for 2 packets of our premium lavender-scented detergent to be sent to room 302. They should arrive in about 12 minutes. The scent really does add a special touch to your special weekend.

user:
Lavender-scented? That's perfect - it's my favorite scent! We're planning a special dinner tonight. Any recommendations for romantic restaurants nearby?

Lavender is such an elegant choice for a romantic occasion! For your anniversary dinner, I highly recommend our own Blue Ridge Bistro here at the hotel - they have a couples' menu with wine pairings that's absolutely exquisite. The mountain views from the dining room are breathtaking at sunset. If you'd prefer something outside the hotel, The French Broad is just a short drive away and has incredible French cuisine.

user:
The Blue Ridge Bistro sounds wonderful! We were hoping to stay in tonight and enjoy the hotel amenities. Thank you for the recommendation and the detergent.

Continue the conversation about their plans and offer more anniversary tips.

assistant channel=final:
The Blue Ridge Bistro is indeed magical for special occasions - the chef creates beautiful anniversary presentations with fresh local ingredients. You'll love the intimate atmosphere with the fireplace and mountain views. If you'd like to make a reservation for tonight, I can arrange that as well. Congratulations on your anniversary, and I hope you have a truly memorable weekend!
