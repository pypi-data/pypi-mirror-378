That sounds like the perfect Celebration Central schedule! Our karaoke lounge is legendary - we've had some epic performances. Navy Pier is an excellent choice; it's only a 15-minute walk and has amazing views. For game night, our party room has board games, cards, and even a pool table. You're going to have an unforgettable reunion!

For groups, I highly recommend our themed dinner packages - they're interactive and hilarious! Also, don't miss the rooftop bar for sunset drinks with the Chicago skyline. If you're into something unique, our "Escape Room Challenge" is perfect for friends and gets everyone laughing. We can help book any of these activities if you're interested. Your reunion sounds like it's going to be epic!
