Kids and ice cream - that sounds like a typical beach day adventure! I've sent 3 detergent packets plus a stain remover to room 825. They should be there in about 8 minutes. While you're waiting, the kids might enjoy our beach treasure hunt activity starting at 4 PM.

You're so welcome! Our beach treasure hunt is always a hit with families - the kids get to explore the shore and look for hidden shells and coins. If they're into building sandcastles, the beach toys are available for rent at the equipment shack. It's been a beautiful day for beach activities!

It really has been gorgeous! The water is so warm and clear. We'll definitely check out those beach toys tomorrow. Thanks again for the detergent and the tips.
