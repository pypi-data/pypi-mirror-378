Hi, could I get a magnifying vanity mirror sent up to 1208? I can’t get close enough to the standard one.

I’ve arranged one magnifying mirror for room 1208. The request is ticket AM-1208-7721 with an estimated 11 minutes to arrival.

user:
Your corner rooms feel roomy despite the counters—nice layout.

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer light small talk drawing from system room facts; no tools needed.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—those corner rooms were designed with extra floor space, so portable mirrors tend to work best there.

user:
Also, could you check if my parcel arrived at reception?

assistant channel=analysis:
Parcel tracking isn’t available via the tools in this dialogue. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for checking in. Looking up the latest information.

user:
Great, I’ll wait for the mirror.
