Good morning! I'm a serious foodie and brought my portable butane burner to prepare some specialty dishes in my suite. I have some amazing ingredients from the local farmers market. Can I set this up on my balcony?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to use a portable butane burner which is an open flame device. I need to check the fire policy first, then offer our culinary facilities and services as alternatives for their cooking interests.

Perfect! I have the fire policy prohibition but excellent culinary facilities that would actually be much better for their specialty cooking than a portable burner.

assistant channel=final:
Good morning, fellow food enthusiast! While portable burners aren't permitted in rooms or on balconies due to fire safety policies, we have something much better - our Chef's Table Studio with 8 professional cooking stations and induction cooktops! You can use your farmers market ingredients with proper equipment and even get technique guidance from our Michelin-trained culinary team. Would you like me to reserve cooking station time for your specialty dishes?

user:
That sounds incredible! The professional equipment would definitely be better than my portable setup. What kind of guidance do your chefs provide?

assistant channel=analysis:
They're excited about using our professional facilities and want to know about the chef guidance. I can provide details about our culinary team services and supervision.

assistant channel=final:
Our Michelin-trained chefs can provide technique guidance, help optimize cooking temperatures and timing for your specific ingredients, suggest wine pairings from our 3,000+ bottle collection, and even teach you professional plating presentations. They're passionate about working with quality ingredients like you found at the farmers market. The Chef's Table Studio has overhead mirrors so you can watch demonstrations closely too.

user:
Your herb gardens must provide amazing fresh ingredients for the restaurant.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual conversation about our gardens. I should respond warmly about our 2-acre organic garden and chef-led experiences.

assistant channel=final:
They absolutely do! Our 2-acre organic garden supplies both our restaurant and cooking classes. The chefs actually lead harvesting experiences where guests can pick herbs and vegetables right before cooking with them - the flavor difference is incredible.

user:
