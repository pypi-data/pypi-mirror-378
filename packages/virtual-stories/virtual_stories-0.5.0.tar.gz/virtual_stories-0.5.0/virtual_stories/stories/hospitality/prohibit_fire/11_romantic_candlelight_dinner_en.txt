We're celebrating our 10th anniversary tonight and would love to have a romantic candlelight dinner in our room. Is that possible?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about candlelight dinner in their room, but the system clearly states no open flames are permitted anywhere indoors. I need to explain the policy and offer the LED flameless alternatives.

assistant channel=final:
For safety, open flames including candles are not permitted anywhere indoors, including guestrooms and balconies. However, we can provide LED flameless candles from our Concierge Kit to create that romantic ambiance safely.
