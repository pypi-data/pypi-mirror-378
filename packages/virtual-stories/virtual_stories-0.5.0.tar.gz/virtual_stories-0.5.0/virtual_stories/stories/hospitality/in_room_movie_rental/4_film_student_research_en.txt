Excellent choices for your cinematography research! I've rented all three films: "Citizen Kane" (revolutionary deep focus cinematography), "Double Indemnity" (innovative lighting and shadow work), and "Sunset Boulevard" (classic Hollywood glamour with sophisticated camera techniques). These include director's commentaries and behind-the-scenes features about the cinematography. That's $21 total.
