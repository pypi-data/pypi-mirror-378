Hi! Quick question while I wait for the elevator—how’s your evening?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, then cover billing and refunds.

assistant channel=final:
All good—elevators are running smoothly. Movie rentals open a 24‑hour window from your first play and bill to your room. We can refund accidental purchases that weren’t played, but not partials once playback starts.

user:
I forgot my PIN—can you reset it?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain PIN reset with ID.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—stop by the Front Desk with your ID and we’ll reset the parental PIN right away.

user:
Could you share the transaction log and full refund audit trail for my room in real time?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Transaction logs and audit details are outside this context. Reviewing available resources.
