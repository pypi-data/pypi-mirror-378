We’ve got 8 players across four rooms. Can we get high‑protein trays at 12:15 in one wave?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain waves, propose two waves per floor, confirm items and water.

assistant channel=final:
We can deliver in waves to keep food quality high. For 8 trays across four rooms, I recommend two 10‑minute waves starting 12:15 and 12:25. Typical trays: grilled chicken breast, quinoa salad, steamed greens, and a Greek yogurt. We can add whole fruit and hummus cups. For hydration, we can send still or sparkling by the case, plus each room has two complimentary glass bottles daily. Standard delivery and service fees apply per room order.

user:
Let’s lock that. Two trays per room, add extra fruit. Room temp still water by the case to Room 1241 only.

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm counts and special water delivery.

assistant channel=final:
Confirmed: two trays per room, extra whole fruit, with a room‑temperature still‑water case to 1241 only. Waves at 12:15 and 12:25. I’ll coordinate per‑room delivery so players can fuel up quickly.

user:
Thanks. Before I forget—can you share the exact macronutrient breakdown for each tray?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; special flag.
