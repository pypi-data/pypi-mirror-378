user:
Hi there! Love the lobby music—so chill. Could I exchange €600 to USD and get an email receipt?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user complimented music (small talk) and asks about exchanging EUR to USD and email receipt. Use system data: supported EUR, fee 1.5% (min $3, max $45), rates fixed 08:00. Confirm ID needs? Amount likely under threshold $1,000? €600 roughly <$1,000 equivalent; room key + name suffice. Offer email receipt.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for the kind words—the jazz trio sets a nice vibe, right? We can exchange your €600 to USD at today’s posted board rate (set at 08:00). There’s a 1.5% service fee (minimum $3, capped at $45), and for this amount your room key with matching name is sufficient. I can email you an itemized receipt—what’s the best email to use?

user:
If I used my borderless debit card instead of cash, would the fee be lower and the rate the same?

assistant channel=analysis:
Borderless debit cash-out fee is 0.8%, posted board rate applies. Confirm no hidden spreads beyond posted rates.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—using your borderless debit card reduces the service fee to 0.8%, and we use the same posted board rate. We don’t add hidden spreads beyond what’s displayed on the rate board.

user:
Can you check the live EUR→USD market right now and beat it by 0.2%?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is beyond system context since we do not provide live market checks or rate beating outside posted policy; invoke special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Rate evaluation requires further review. Checking available options.
