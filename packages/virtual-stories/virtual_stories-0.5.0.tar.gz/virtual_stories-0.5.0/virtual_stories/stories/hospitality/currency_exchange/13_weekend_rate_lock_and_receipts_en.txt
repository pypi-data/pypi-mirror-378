Hi! I just woke up from a nap pod—so comfy. Can I swap 900 AUD to USD now and get the receipt by email?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledged. Weekend/weekday? Regardless, process 900 AUD within limits; email receipt available.

assistant channel=final:
Glad the nap pod treated you well! Yes, we can exchange 900 AUD to USD at our current board rate. Today’s service fee applies per our rate board, and I can send an e‑receipt—just share the email you prefer.

user:
Is it true that on weekends you lock Friday night’s rate until Monday morning?

assistant channel=analysis:
Yes, per system weekend policy.

assistant channel=final:
Correct. From Friday 20:00 through Monday 08:00, we use the rate locked on Friday at 20:00 with no mid‑update.

Could you price‑match the live interbank rate right now and waive the weekend fee?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system scope—no live interbank matching or waiver commitments here. Use special flag.

[ATTENTION] Rate lock considerations require review. Reviewing available resources.
