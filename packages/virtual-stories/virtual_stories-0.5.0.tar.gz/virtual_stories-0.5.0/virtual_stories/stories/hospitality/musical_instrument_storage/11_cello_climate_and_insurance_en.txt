Hello! First—your lobby pianist is fantastic. I’m traveling with a cello and want to make sure it’s stored properly. What can you do for humidity control?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, then provide climate details and process.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—we’ll pass that to our pianist. For your cello, we can place it in our instrument closet kept at 45–55% humidity and 20–22°C, monitored twice daily. We’ll tag it and secure it in our back‑of‑house cage.

user:
That sounds right. Could I access it late tonight after my rehearsal ends at 23:30?

assistant channel=analysis:
Access hours end 23:00; after-hours requires Security escort.

assistant channel=final:
We can arrange an after‑hours Security escort at 23:30 so you can retrieve it safely. There’s no charge for holds under 24 hours.

Could you email me the exact text of your liability policy rider and the insurer’s underwriter contact?

Beyond provided facts; use special flag and end.
