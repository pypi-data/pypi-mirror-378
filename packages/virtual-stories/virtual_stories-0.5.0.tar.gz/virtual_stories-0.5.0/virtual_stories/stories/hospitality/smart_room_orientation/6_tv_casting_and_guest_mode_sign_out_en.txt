Open the TV’s welcome screen and scan the QR, join the room Wi‑Fi, then approve casting on your phone. You’ll be auto-signed-out at checkout (or after 24 hours idle); you can also go to Settings > Accounts and Sign out anytime.

user:
Cool—does casting affect the room Wi‑Fi speed?

assistant channel=analysis:
Give brief guidance.

assistant channel=final:
It shares the same network, so very heavy casting can use bandwidth; pausing or lowering streaming quality helps if needed.
