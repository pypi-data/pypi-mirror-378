Hi, how do I dim the lights and set the curtains halfway?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide voice commands; small talk.

assistant channel=final:
You can say, “dim lights to 30%” and “open curtains to 50%.” The system will confirm on the wall tablet. Trying out the Relax scene tonight?

What temperature range can the thermostat handle?

You can set it between 18°C and 26°C. Energy Saver will ease settings if the room is unoccupied, then resume when you return.
