Hi! Those mountains are stunning. I'm in room 302 and can't figure out the smart blinds—could you send a quick guide to my phone +41790001111?

The Alps do put on a show! I've texted you a link with instructions for the blinds and other smart controls. Let me know if it doesn't come through.

user:
Got it, thanks! Can I control things with voice, too?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer about voice commands; no tool needed.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—just say "Hey Alpine" followed by the command, like "close blinds" or "set lights to warm." Enjoy the tech and the view!
