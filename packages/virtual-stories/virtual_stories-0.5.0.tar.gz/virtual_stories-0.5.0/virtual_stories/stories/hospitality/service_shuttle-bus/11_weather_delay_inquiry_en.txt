Good morning! I have a flight at 2 PM and I'm worried about the heavy rain forecast. Will the shuttle still run on time?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is concerned about weather delays affecting their 2 PM flight. I need to provide information about our weather policy and suggest alternatives if needed.

assistant channel=final:
Good morning! Our shuttle service continues during light rain, but severe weather may cause 15-30 minute delays. For your 2 PM flight, I'd recommend booking the 12:30 PM departure to allow extra buffer time. We also have private car service available for $45 if you prefer a more direct option.

user:
That sounds reasonable. Can you tell me more about the private car service?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for details about the private car service, which is mentioned in our system information.

assistant channel=final:
Our private car service provides direct transportation to Miami International Airport for $45. It's a luxury sedan with professional driver, and the travel time is typically 20-25 minutes. Would you like me to arrange that for you instead?

user:
Actually, I think I'll stick with the shuttle. Can you reserve me for the 12:30 PM departure? Room 847.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to book the 12:30 PM shuttle departure. However, I don't have access to booking tools since this is a no-tools dialogue. I should provide information about how to make the reservation.

assistant channel=final:
I'd be happy to help you reserve the 12:30 PM shuttle! Please contact our front desk at extension 2000 or visit the concierge desk to confirm your booking for room 847. They'll provide you with a confirmation number and pickup details.

user:
Perfect! One more question - do you know if there are any construction delays on the route to the airport today?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about construction delays, which is not information provided in our system context. This requires the ATTENTION flag.
