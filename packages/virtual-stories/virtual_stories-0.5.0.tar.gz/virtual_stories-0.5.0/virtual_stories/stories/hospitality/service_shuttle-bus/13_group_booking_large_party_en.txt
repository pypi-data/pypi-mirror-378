Good afternoon! We have a group of 8 people checking out tomorrow and need shuttle service to LAX. Do you offer any group discounts?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about group booking for 8 people and group discounts. I need to provide information about our group policy and booking requirements.

assistant channel=final:
Good afternoon! Yes, we do offer special group rates for parties of 8 or more passengers. Since you have 8 people, you'll qualify for our group discount. However, groups of 6+ require advance reservation and may need multiple vehicles since our shuttle capacity is 12 passengers. You'll need to reserve at least 4 hours in advance.

That sounds perfect! What time would you recommend for a 3 PM flight departure?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for timing recommendations for a 3 PM flight. I need to consider travel time and suggest appropriate departure times.

assistant channel=final:
For a 3 PM flight, I'd recommend departing around 1 PM to allow for the 40-50 minute journey to LAX plus airport check-in time. This gives you a comfortable buffer. Would you like me to connect you with our group services coordinator to arrange the booking?

user:
Yes, please! Also, do you provide any special services for groups?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about special group services, which are mentioned in our system information.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! For groups, we provide a dedicated group coordinator, priority boarding, and group luggage handling. We also offer complimentary sunscreen and towels, plus beach bag storage since we're a beach resort. Our group services coordinator can arrange all the details for you.

user:
That's wonderful! Can you tell me about the pickup locations?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about pickup locations, which are mentioned in our system information.

assistant channel=final:
We have three convenient pickup points: the main lobby, beach cabana area, and poolside entrance. All areas are covered for weather protection. Our group coordinator can help you choose the most convenient location for your party.
