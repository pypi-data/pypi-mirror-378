Between vinyl and kneaded erasers, which one smudges less?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use catalog description precisely; avoid new claims.

assistant channel=commentary:
The system notes vinyl as “low smear,” kneaded is moldable.

assistant channel=final:
Vinyl is the lower‑smear option; kneaded is best if you want a moldable eraser for selective lifting.

user:
Do you have a small sharpener with a built-in reservoir?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from Sharpeners list.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—our compact double‑hole travel sharpener includes a shavings reservoir.

user:
Love the greenery in your lobby.

assistant channel=analysis:
Keep it light and factual-neutral.

assistant channel=final:
Appreciate it—thanks for the kind note.
