That's awesome! I'm heading out for some local riding. Any route recommendations?

assistant channel=final:
For local riding, I recommend the Coastal Highway route - it's a scenic 45-mile loop with great ocean views and minimal traffic. The roads are well-maintained with plenty of pull-offs. We have detailed maps in the rider's lounge and can arrange guided tours with local motorcycle clubs. Just let me know if you need fuel recommendations along the way!
