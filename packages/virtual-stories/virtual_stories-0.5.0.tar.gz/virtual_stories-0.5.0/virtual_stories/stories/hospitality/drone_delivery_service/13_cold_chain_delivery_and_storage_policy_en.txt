Hello! Gorgeous skyline today. Quick question about a medicated gel coming in.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk then policy: perishables/temperature-sensitive not accepted.

assistant channel=final:
It really is a beautiful day. For drone deliveries, we can’t accept temperature‑sensitive or perishable items, but non‑perishables can be placed in a secure locker for up to 6 hours.

user:
If it arrives anyway, can you refrigerate it for me?

assistant channel=analysis:
System: perishables not accepted.

assistant channel=final:
We’re unable to hold perishables or temperature‑sensitive items. If the sender can switch to a non‑perishable shipment, we can store it securely.

user:
Could you check the manufacturer’s stability sheet to see if 6 hours at room temp is safe?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Stability documentation requires additional review. I'm looking into this.
