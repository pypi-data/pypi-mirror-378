Good morning! My wife and I are both 72 and love staying active. We used to play squash 30 years ago—do you have anything suitable for seniors?

Wonderful that you're staying active! We have senior-modified courts with slower-bounce balls, enhanced lighting, and lightweight ergonomic rackets. Morning slots available: 9, 10, or 11 AM.

user:
10 AM sounds perfect for both of us. Could we try shorter sessions? An hour might be too much to start.

Excellent planning! Your 10:00 AM court (SENIOR-SQ-1000) can be 30 or 60 minutes—you decide during play. Two lightweight ergonomic rackets with arthritis-friendly grips are ready.

user:
This is exactly what we needed. We've been enjoying the aqua fitness classes too—such a thoughtful program for seniors.

assistant channel=analysis:
Couple appreciating our senior programming. Share additional age-appropriate activities.

assistant channel=final:
So glad you're enjoying them! We also have balance-focused yoga for fall prevention and gentle hiking trails with rest stations every quarter-mile.

Those hiking trails sound lovely! Do they have guided nature walks with bird watching opportunities?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guided nature walks and bird watching aren't specified in the hiking trail details.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That would be a wonderful addition to the trails. Exploring available arrangements.
