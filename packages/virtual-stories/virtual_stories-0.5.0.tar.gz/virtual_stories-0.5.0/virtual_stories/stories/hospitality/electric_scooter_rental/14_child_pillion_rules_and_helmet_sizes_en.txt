Hi! Can my 13-year-old ride with me on the same scooter if we go slowly on the Botanic Loop?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use one-rider rule and minimum age.

assistant channel=final:
For safety, each scooter is limited to one rider. Riders must be 16+ with a photo ID. The Botanic Loop is a good family route, and we can size helmets from youth S to adult XL for each rider.

Could you confirm whether the school district allowed scooters to traverse the southern crosswalk during construction detours this month?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system context (school district policy). Use special flag.

[ATTENTION] Thanks for flagging the construction detour question. Searching for more information.
