We’re seeing showers this afternoon. Will the scooters still go out? Also, what if the storm gets worse mid-ride?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use rain operation, wind/lightning thresholds, refund window.

assistant channel=final:
We continue operating in light rain, and we’ll offer ponchos. If winds exceed 35 km/h or lightning is detected within 10 km, departures pause and we wait 30 minutes after the last strike. For mid-ride disruptions: if we pause your ride and the total time is under 15 minutes, you can choose a full refund or a credit.

user:
Is the Old Market area extra slippery? We’re planning photos there.

assistant channel=analysis:
Mention geofence slow mode and safety.

assistant channel=final:
Old Market’s cobblestones can be slick, so our rain mode automatically limits speed to 10 km/h there. Lights are required, and we recommend gentle braking—our team also swaps to wet-weather brake pads at 13:00 daily.

user:
By the way, your lobby has a lovely cedar scent—nice touch.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—we diffuse a light cedar blend in the afternoons to match the waterfront feel.

user:
Could you verify if the city’s transportation department extended the refund guidelines for third-party scooter operators this week?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond our system context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I appreciate you raising the refund guideline question. Checking available options.
