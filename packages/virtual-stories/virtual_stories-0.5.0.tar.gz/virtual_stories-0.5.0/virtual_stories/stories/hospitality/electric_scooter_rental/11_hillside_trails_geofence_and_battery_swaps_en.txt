Hi there! We’re thinking of taking scooters up the north hillside trails before breakfast. Is that allowed and which models are best?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm trail-rated requirement, rental hours, and recommend trail units and helmet sizes. Mention geofence and speed cap facts from system.

assistant channel=final:
Great timing—Hillside Trails North is available for the trail-rated scooters only, and they’re capped at 18 km/h on descents per our geofence. We open at 06:30, with last checkout at 20:30 and returns by 21:30. For the climb, I recommend the trail-rated units (28 km/h cap, ~38–45 km per charge). We have MIPS helmets from XS to XL, plus reflective vests if you’ll be riding near dawn.

user:
If our batteries dip low near Green Lake, can we swap there or only back at the hotel?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer using battery swap locations and pricing from system.

assistant channel=final:
You can swap at either location: our porte-cochère bay B or the Green Lake kiosk. The kiosk runs 10:00–18:00. Your first same-day swap is free; a second swap the same day is $6.

user:
Cool. Also, can we zip through the university just to cross the quad? It’s the shortest way.

assistant channel=analysis:
Respond with no-ride zone rule from system.

assistant channel=final:
The university campus is a no-ride zone—scooters will auto-stop after about 15 meters inside its boundary. To pass through, you’ll need to dismount and walk across, or route around via Old Town Core (that area runs at a slow 10 km/h geofence).

user:
Got it. Quick one—do you know if the city is lifting the hillside trail seasonal maintenance closure early this year? A park ranger hinted at it last week.

assistant channel=analysis:
This asks about a municipality decision beyond our system context. Acknowledge and pass to background agent with the special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Appreciate the heads-up about the trail schedule. Searching for more information.
