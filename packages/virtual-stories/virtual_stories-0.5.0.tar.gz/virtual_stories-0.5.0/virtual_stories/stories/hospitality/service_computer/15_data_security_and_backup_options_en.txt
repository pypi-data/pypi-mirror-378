Can you help me set up a cryptocurrency wallet and blockchain integration for my business transactions?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about cryptocurrency wallet setup and blockchain integration. This is completely outside the scope of business center services and would likely involve financial services and cryptocurrency trading, which are not part of the hotel's business center offerings.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Cryptocurrency and blockchain services aren't available through our business center resources. Checking available options.
