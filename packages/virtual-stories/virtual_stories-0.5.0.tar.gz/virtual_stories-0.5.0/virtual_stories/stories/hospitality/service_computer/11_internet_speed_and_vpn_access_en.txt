What's the internet speed like here? I need to do some video calls and upload large files for work.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about internet speed and capabilities. I have detailed information about the network infrastructure in the system prompt, including speed specifications and peak hour considerations.

assistant channel=final:
Our Business Center has enterprise-grade fiber with 1 Gbps dedicated bandwidth and Wi-Fi 6 support. Each workstation has Gigabit Ethernet ports for optimal performance. During peak hours (08:00–10:00 and 18:00–20:00), you might see about 20% speed reduction, but it's still very reliable for video calls and large file uploads. We have Zoom, Teams, and WebEx pre-installed, plus cloud storage access to Google Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox.

Perfect! The East Wing location is convenient too.

Great to hear! The Level 3 location does make it easy to access from the guest floors.

user:
Can I use my company's VPN to access our internal systems?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about VPN usage. According to the system prompt, personal VPN software is allowed, but corporate VPNs may require IT approval. This seems like a reasonable request that falls within the scope of the business center services.

assistant channel=final:
Personal VPN software is allowed on our systems. For corporate VPNs, you may need IT approval - our on-site IT specialist is available 09:00–17:00 weekdays at +1 212 555 8801. They can help configure your VPN and ensure it works properly with our network security protocols.

user:
Actually, can you help me set up a cryptocurrency mining rig using these computers?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about cryptocurrency mining, which is completely outside the scope of business center services and would likely violate hotel policies regarding computer usage and power consumption.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That request goes beyond our available services here. Checking available options.
