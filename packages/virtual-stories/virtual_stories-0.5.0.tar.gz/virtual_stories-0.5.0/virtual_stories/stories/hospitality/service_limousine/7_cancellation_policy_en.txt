If I cancel 90 minutes before pickup, what happens?

assistant channel=analysis:
Inside 2 hours triggers a 1‑hour charge per policy. Use tool to echo policy.

assistant channel=final:
If you cancel 90 minutes before, it falls inside the 2‑hour window, so a 1‑hour charge applies.

Can you waive it if my flight is delayed?
