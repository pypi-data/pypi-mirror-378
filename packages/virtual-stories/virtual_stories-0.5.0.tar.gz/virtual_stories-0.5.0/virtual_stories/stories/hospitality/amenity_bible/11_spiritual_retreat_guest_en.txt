Beautiful choices for your spiritual journey! I'll arrange the King James Bible with study guide and devotional journal immediately. For meditation sessions, we offer daily guided meditations with biblical themes such as "Peace that Passes Understanding" and "Walking in Faith." Our certified spiritual directors lead these sessions in our meditation garden overlooking the red rocks. Sessions are available at sunrise, midday, and sunset. When would you like to join a meditation session?

Wonderful! I've reserved your spot for tomorrow's sunrise meditation session at 6 AM. Our spiritual reading library offers classic devotionals by authors like Oswald Chambers and C.S. Lewis, plus contemporary spiritual guides and books on contemplative prayer. We have works on spiritual formation, biblical studies, and mystical traditions. All materials can be delivered to your room or accessed in our quiet reading nooks. What types of spiritual reading interest you most?

Actually, I was wondering if you could help me find a good spiritual guide or retreat center nearby for some additional guidance?
