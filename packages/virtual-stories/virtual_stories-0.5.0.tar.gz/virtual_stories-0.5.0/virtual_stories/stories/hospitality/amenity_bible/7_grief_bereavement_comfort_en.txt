What a beautiful testament to your mother's faith legacy! Finding comfort in the scriptures she loved is a wonderful way to feel connected to her spirit and the values she instilled in you. Her faithful example continues to guide you even now.

She really was amazing. I'm trying to find peace with God's plan, even though it's so hard to understand why now.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest wrestling with theological questions about God's timing and plan during grief. This is within pastoral care to acknowledge the struggle while offering comfort.

assistant channel=final:
Questioning God's timing during loss is part of the human experience of grief - even the strongest faith can wrestle with "why now" questions. Your struggle doesn't diminish your faith; it's honest and shows the depth of your love for your mother.

user:
I'm wondering - are there theological perspectives on whether we reunite with loved ones after death, or is that more hope than doctrine?

assistant channel=analysis:
Complex theological questions about afterlife doctrines and reunion require theological expertise beyond my bereavement coordination scope. Use special flag.

[ATTENTION] Important theological question about afterlife and reunion doctrines. Researching spiritual resources.
