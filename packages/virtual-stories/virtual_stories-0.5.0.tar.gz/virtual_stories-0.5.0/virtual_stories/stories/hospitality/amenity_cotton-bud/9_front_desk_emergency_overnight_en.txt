user:
Hi—it’s pretty late. Could I get cotton buds now? I’m awake in room 410 and not sure if pickup or delivery is faster.

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer both options with typical times; if delivery chosen, dispatch overnight.

assistant channel=final:
We can do either: delivery to room 410 in about 15–25 minutes, or stage a pack at the front desk for immediate pickup. Which do you prefer?

user:
Delivery would be best—thanks.

assistant channel=final:
All set—overnight delivery is on the way and should arrive in about 20 minutes. We’ll observe quiet corridor guidelines. Complimentary.

user:
Thanks! Also, will the Northern Lights be visible tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope—flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’ll check the current aurora forecast and visibility. Investigating potential answers.
