Hi there! I'm really excited to try authentic Greek food, but I'm worried about ordering since I don't speak Greek. Could you help me with some basic phrases for restaurants?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest wants dining phrases in Greek. I should use the dining translation tool to provide helpful phrases for ordering food.

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide the translation phrases to the guest and offer additional help. I should also suggest some local restaurants.

I'd be delighted to help you experience authentic Greek cuisine! Here are some essential phrases:

Wow, these are perfect! I can already imagine myself at a cozy taverna. The Acropolis view from my room is absolutely stunning—I'm so glad I chose this hotel.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is expressing appreciation for the hotel view. I should acknowledge their compliment and offer more dining suggestions without using tools.

assistant channel=final:
The Acropolis view is spectacular, isn't it? We get so many compliments about it. For authentic Greek dining, I recommend Taverna Xinos right in the Plaka district—it's been serving traditional dishes like moussaka and souvlaki since 1939. Just show them your hotel key for a special discount!

user:
That sounds amazing! Is there a particular dish I absolutely must try while I'm here?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking for dining recommendations. I can provide this information from hotel knowledge without tools.

assistant channel=final:
You absolutely must try the moussaka—it's our national dish with layers of eggplant, ground meat, and béchamel sauce. Also, don't miss the Greek salad with our local feta cheese and the freshest olives. If you're adventurous, try the grilled octopus! All are much better when ordered in Greek with your new phrases.
