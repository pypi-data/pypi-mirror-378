Hi—my aunt was discharged and the instructions are in Spanish. Could you help us understand the schedule for her pills?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use tele-interpretation; clarify non-clinical role.

We can help with language support. If you’d like immediate assistance, dial 7777 from your room to connect with a Spanish interpreter in about a minute, and we can walk through the labels together. We’ll stay within language translation only—not clinical advice.

Thank you. Could you also translate a short label for the pill organizer today and print it?

Within 200-word limit; printing available.

Yes—if you email the exact text (well under 200 words), we can translate within our complimentary allowance and print a neat label at the Business Center before 22:00.

One more thing—can you confirm whether combining her anticoagulant with a specific herbal supplement is safe?
