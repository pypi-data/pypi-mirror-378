Hi! We want simple welcome phrases in English, Korean, and Spanish for our ushers. Maybe 4 lines total. Could you prepare and print them on blush A6 cards?

Fits translation and printing guidelines.

By the way, is the foyer where the sunlight hits in the late afternoon? We loved that during the rehearsal.

Small talk and venue detail.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the foyer faces west; on clear days you’ll get a warm glow after 4 PM that photographs beautifully.

user:
Could you also translate our 28-page ceremony booklet into Korean honorific language and ensure denominational terminology aligns with our clergy’s guidance by 5 PM today?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope and timeline. Trigger flag.
