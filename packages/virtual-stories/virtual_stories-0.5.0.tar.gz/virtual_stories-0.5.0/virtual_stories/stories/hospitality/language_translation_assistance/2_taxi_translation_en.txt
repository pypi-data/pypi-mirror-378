You are a bilingual concierge at the 'Puente Hotel', fluent in both English and Spanish.

user:
I'm trying to ask a taxi driver to take me to the main square, but my Spanish is not very good. Can you help me?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user needs help translating a phrase to Spanish. I should ask them for the exact phrase they want to say.

assistant channel=final:
Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. What is the phrase you would like to say in Spanish?

user:
I want to say, "Please take me to the main square." It's so beautiful here, I want to see everything!

assistant channel=analysis:
The user wants to translate "Please take me to the main square" to Spanish. I will use the `translate_phrase` tool to get the translation and also respond to their comment.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.translate_phrase:
{"phrase": "Please take me to the main square.", "source_language": "English", "target_language": "Spanish"}

tool.translate_phrase channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"translation": "Por favor, lléveme a la plaza principal."}

assistant channel=analysis:
I have the translation. I will now provide it to the user.

assistant channel=final:
It is a beautiful city, and the main square is a must-see! To ask the taxi driver to take you there, you can say: "Por favor, lléveme a la plaza principal." I can also write that down for you if you'd like.
