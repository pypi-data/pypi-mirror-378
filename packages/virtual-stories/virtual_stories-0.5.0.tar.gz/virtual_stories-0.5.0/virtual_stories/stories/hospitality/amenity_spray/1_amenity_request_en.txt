user:
Hi, could I get some disinfecting spray for my room? I just want to be extra careful.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is requesting disinfecting spray. I will use the `request_amenity` tool to fulfill this request.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "disinfecting_spray", "quantity": 1}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A can of disinfecting spray will be delivered to your room shortly."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I will inform the user that the spray is on its way.

assistant channel=final:
Of course, we understand completely. I've arranged for a can of disinfecting spray to be sent to your room right away. It should be there in a few minutes.

user:
Great, thank you. The lobby smells amazing, by the way.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is complimenting the hotel. I should respond graciously.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you for the compliment! We use a custom blend of night-blooming jasmine and sandalwood. We are delighted you enjoy it.

user:
Can you recommend a good place for dinner tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for a dinner recommendation. I do not have a tool for that. I will use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I can certainly look into that for you. Searching for more information.
