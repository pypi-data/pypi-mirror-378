user:
Can you configure the power adapters to automatically monitor my patients' vital signs through the connected medical devices and send real-time alerts to the nearest hospital emergency room if abnormal readings are detected?

assistant channel=analysis:
This request involves patient vital sign monitoring, real-time medical data transmission to hospital emergency rooms, and automated medical alerts, which would require FDA-approved medical monitoring systems and direct hospital integration far beyond adapter capabilities, plus it involves practicing medicine.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Patient monitoring and hospital emergency integration require specialized FDA-approved medical systems. Reviewing available medical equipment resources.
