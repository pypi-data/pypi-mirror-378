I'd be delighted to arrange the lavender aromatherapy blend and chromotherapy lighting for villa 15! Our lavender blend is perfect for relaxation and stress relief, and the chromotherapy lighting can be set to calming blue tones to enhance the therapeutic experience. The system will be ready for your use within 10-15 minutes. Would you like me to also adjust the body jets to a gentle massage setting?
