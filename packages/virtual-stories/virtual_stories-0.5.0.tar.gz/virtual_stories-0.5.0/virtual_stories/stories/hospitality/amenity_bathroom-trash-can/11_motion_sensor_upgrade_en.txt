Good morning! I'm staying in room 1847. I noticed some hotels have those motion-sensor trash cans in bathrooms. Do you offer anything like that here?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about motion-sensor trash bins. Based on system info, these are available on premium floors 18-22, but guest is in room 1847 (floor 18). I should confirm availability and offer the upgrade.

Good morning! You're in luck - premium floors 18-22 feature motion-sensor bathroom bins with silent operation. Since you're on floor 18, I can arrange to have one installed in your room within 45 minutes.

That sounds perfect! I'm always touching things with my hands full. How does the maintenance work with the sensors?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest wants to know about sensor maintenance. The system mentions IoT connectivity for monitoring - I should explain this feature and reassure about reliability.

The bins have IoT connectivity that monitors capacity and sensor functionality in real-time. Our maintenance team receives automated alerts if anything needs attention, so they're always operating smoothly without disrupting your stay.

Excellent! Also, I love the Observatory theme in this room. The constellation maps are beautiful.
