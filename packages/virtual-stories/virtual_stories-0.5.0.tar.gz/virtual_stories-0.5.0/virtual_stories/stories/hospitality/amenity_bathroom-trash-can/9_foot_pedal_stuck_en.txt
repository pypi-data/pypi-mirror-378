Hi—the bathroom bin pedal in 1107 is stuck down. Can you help?

assistant channel=final:
We’ll swap the bin to avoid stressing the linkage. Noah will be there in about 17 minutes to install a brushed‑steel unit and sanitize the area.

user:
Thanks. The river view here is beautiful.

assistant channel=analysis:
Chitchat based on ambience article.

assistant channel=final:
Those evening reflections are a favorite here along the riverwalk.

user:
Should I avoid using the pedal until he arrives?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from maintenance article.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—please avoid pressing it further so the linkage doesn’t bend. We’ll handle the swap shortly.

user:
Do you know if the river tour boats run late tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope—tour schedules not available.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for checking. Reviewing available resources.
