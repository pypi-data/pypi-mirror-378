Palm Court Seaside (hotel_id: pcs_mia_beach_07)
Address: 500 Ocean Dr, Miami Beach, FL 33139
Timezone: America/New_York

Service Notes:
- Housekeeping cycles every day; odor-control kits on all beach floors.
- Deodorizers available: citrus (fresh), eucalyptus (spa-like), and unscented.
- Mop-and-sanitize may be added if any leakage occurred.

Article One — Coastal Environment:
Humidity can intensify odors; our rooms use marine-grade ventilation and quick-dry tiles to keep bathrooms fresh. Beach floors get extra odor‑control rounds during peak season.

Article Two — Materials & Cleaning:
Bins are double-walled plastic with antimicrobial coating. Sanitization uses a neutral pH cleaner followed by a food‑safe deodorizer that leaves no residue on tiles.

Article Three — Guest Options:
Unscented deodorizers are available for scent-sensitive guests, and we can replace liners with charcoal‑infused variants on request. A mop service can be added if the area around the bin was splashed.

Article Four — Operations:
The team documents deep‑clean timestamps in the housekeeping log. If odor returns within 24 hours, we proactively replace the inner caddy to rule out micro‑cracks.

Article Five — Neighborhood:
Steps from Ocean Drive, evening sea breezes and live music carry softly to our promenade, while guest corridors remain quiet after 10 PM.

On it—sanitization is scheduled. Kayla will arrive in about 20 minutes to sanitize the bin, replace the liner, and mop the floor. We’ll use an unscented deodorizer per your floor’s standard kit.

Appreciate it. The bathroom fan is pretty quiet, by the way.

Do you know which beach bars have live salsa tonight?
