I need 50 pages copied for a presentation tomorrow morning, with spiral binding and color covers. What's the total cost?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest needs comprehensive presentation materials with binding and finishing. I should provide detailed pricing for copying, binding, and covers.

assistant channel=final:
For 50 pages with spiral binding and color covers, that would be USD 7.50 for copying (50 × USD 0.15), plus USD 3.00 for spiral binding and USD 2.00 for color covers - total USD 12.50. We'll provide professional finishing with quality control inspection.
