Hi! I'm the best man and we have five groomsmen getting ready in the bridal party suite. Could we get some shoe-cleaning cloths for everyone? The ceremony starts in two hours and we want to make sure everyone's dress shoes are perfect.

Wedding party needs multiple shoe-cleaning cloths for formal ceremony preparation. Should provide cloths and offer additional wedding services available in the system.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations on the upcoming ceremony! I'll arrange for five premium European shoe-cleaning cloths to be delivered to your bridal party suite immediately—these are part of our professional-grade collection designed specifically for formal events. Since you're preparing for such a special occasion, our gentleman's grooming station is also available with traditional barber services and professional shoe shine using imported Italian leather conditioners if you'd like that extra touch of perfection.

That would be amazing! The groom is a bit nervous, so we're trying to keep everything relaxed in here.

assistant channel=analysis:
Should acknowledge the situation and mention available relaxation services for the wedding party.

assistant channel=final:
I completely understand—wedding day nerves are natural! Along with the shoe-cleaning cloths, you might consider our relaxation pods with aromatherapy which are perfect for calming pre-ceremony jitters. The groom's preparation lounge also has comfortable vintage leather seating and we can arrange a complimentary champagne toast setup to help everyone unwind before the big moment.
