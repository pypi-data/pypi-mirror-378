I'm a cigar enthusiast and would love to enjoy a premium cigar in your lounge. Is smoking allowed?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about smoking in the lounge, but the system clearly states that the lounge is 100% smoke-free indoors. I need to explain this policy and direct them to the designated outdoor smoking garden.

assistant channel=final:
Indoors are 100% smoke-free, including the lounge, restaurants, and all public areas. However, we have a designated outdoor smoking garden behind the Northeast Gate, open 07:00–22:00 with wind screens and receptacles provided.
