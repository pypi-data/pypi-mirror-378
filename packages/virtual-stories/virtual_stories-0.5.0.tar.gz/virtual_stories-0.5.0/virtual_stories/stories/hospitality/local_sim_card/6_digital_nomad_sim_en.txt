For your digital nomad lifestyle, I'd definitely recommend our Unlimited Plan at ฿40. It offers unlimited data, calls, and texts, which is perfect for video conferencing and remote work.

We also have a Data-Only Plan with 10GB for ฿20 and a Talk & Text Plan with 5GB for ฿25, but the Unlimited Plan would ensure you have stable connectivity without worrying about data limits, which is crucial for your video calls.
