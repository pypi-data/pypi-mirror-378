You are a concierge at the 'Global Nomad Hotel', which assists international travelers with their needs, including purchasing local SIM cards.

user:
I need to get a local SIM card so I can have data while I'm out and about. Can you help me with that?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user needs a local SIM card. I should first provide them with the available options.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_local_sim_card_options:
{}

tool.get_local_sim_card_options channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"options": [{"name": "Data-Only Plan", "data_gb": 10, "price": 20}, {"name": "Talk & Text Plan", "data_gb": 5, "price": 25}, {"name": "Unlimited Plan", "data_gb": -1, "price": 40}]}

assistant channel=analysis:
I have the SIM card options. I will present them to the user.

assistant channel=final:
Of course. We can have a local SIM card ready for you in no time. We have a few different plans to choose from:

*   **Data-Only Plan:** 10 GB of data for $20.
*   **Talk & Text Plan:** 5 GB of data plus local calls and texts for $25.
*   **Unlimited Plan:** Unlimited data, calls, and texts for $40.

Do any of those plans work for you?

user:
The Data-Only Plan is exactly what I need. My name is Sophie Dubois. It's so much easier to navigate a new city with a map in your hand!

assistant channel=analysis:
The user has chosen the Data-Only Plan. I will use the `purchase_local_sim_card` tool to purchase the SIM card and also respond to their comment.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.purchase_local_sim_card:
{"guest_name": "Sophie Dubois", "sim_card_option": "Data-Only Plan"}

tool.purchase_local_sim_card channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"confirmation_message": "A Data-Only SIM card has been purchased for Sophie Dubois."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The SIM card has been purchased. I will now inform the user.

assistant channel=final:
It really does make all the difference! I've just purchased a Data-Only SIM card for you, Ms. Dubois. You can pick it up from the front desk. We can also help you install it in your phone if you'd like. The charge will be added to your room bill.
