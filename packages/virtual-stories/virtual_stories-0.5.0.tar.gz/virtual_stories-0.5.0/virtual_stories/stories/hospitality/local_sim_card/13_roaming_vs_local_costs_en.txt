Hi! The aquarium in the lobby is mesmerizing—what fish is that?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; return to connectivity.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a small reef setup—great for a moment of calm. For data, local eSIM packs are usually cheaper than roaming: 10 GB/10 days or 20 GB/15 days, with speeds throttled to 512 kbps after you hit the cap.

user:
My carrier offers $10/day roaming. Is local still better for streaming?

assistant channel=analysis:
Compare with hotel Wi‑Fi and throttle impact.

assistant channel=final:
If you’ll stream regularly, a local 20 GB plan plus our hotel Wi‑Fi (150–250 Mbps) is typically smoother. After using your plan’s data, 512 kbps throttling will make HD video difficult.

user:
Can you check my carrier’s specific roaming thresholds and apply travel pass now?

Beyond context; special flag.

[ATTENTION] Thanks—gathering relevant data on roaming details and travel pass enrollment.
