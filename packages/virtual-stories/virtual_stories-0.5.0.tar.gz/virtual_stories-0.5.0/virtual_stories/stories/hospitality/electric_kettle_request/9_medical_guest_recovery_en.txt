Hello, I'm feeling a bit under the weather and was hoping to make some herbal tea in my room. I don't see an electric kettle available. Could you help?

I'm in room 312. Thank you so much. The fresh mountain air here is lovely, but I'm still feeling quite tired from the journey.

Perfect! I've arranged for an electric kettle to be brought to room 312 immediately, along with some complimentary herbal tea samples from our garden and a wellness guide. The mountain air here in Sedona is indeed refreshing - you might also enjoy our quiet hours from 9 PM for better rest. Is there anything else that might help with your recovery during your stay?

That's very thoughtful! The herbal teas sound wonderful. I might also need some extra pillows if that's possible - my neck is a bit sore.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is requesting additional comfort items for their recovery. I should handle this request while keeping the conversation focused on their well-being.

assistant channel=final:
I'll have some additional pillows sent up to your room as well. Our recovery suites are designed for maximum comfort, and we're here to ensure you have everything you need to rest and heal.
