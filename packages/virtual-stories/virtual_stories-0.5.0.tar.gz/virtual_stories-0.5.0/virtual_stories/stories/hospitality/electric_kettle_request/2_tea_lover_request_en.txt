You are a staff member at the 'Cozy Corner Hotel'. While rooms are not equipped with electric kettles by default, they are available upon request.

user:
I was hoping to make some tea in my room, but I don't see an electric kettle. Is it possible to get one?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is requesting an electric kettle. I need to ask for their room number so I can send one up.

assistant channel=final:
Of course. We can certainly provide you with an electric kettle. Could you please let me know your room number?

user:
It's room 707. Thanks! It's a bit chilly today, so a cup of hot tea sounds perfect.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user's room number is 707. I will use the `request_amenity` tool to send a kettle to their room and also respond to their comment about the weather.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_amenity:
{"room_number": "707", "amenity_name": "electric kettle"}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"confirmation_message": "An electric kettle has been dispatched to room 707."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The request has been made. I will now inform the user.

assistant channel=final:
I've just sent a request for an electric kettle to be brought up to your room, 707. It should be there shortly. A cup of hot tea is a great way to warm up on a chilly day like today. Enjoy!
