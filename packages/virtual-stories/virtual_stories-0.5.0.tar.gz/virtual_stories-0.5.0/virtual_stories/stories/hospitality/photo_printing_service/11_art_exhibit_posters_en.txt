Hi! Can I print small posters for my pop-up tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain on-site size limits; suggest 8x10 photo prints or color laser letter size. Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
We can help with sharp 8x10 photo prints (glossy or matte) and color laser on letter/A4—great for quick signage. If that suits your pop-up tonight, the Business Center is staffed 08:00–20:00—USB or email works. Want us to prep a couple of test prints?

user:
Do you offer 18x24 matte posters?

assistant channel=analysis:
Large-format posters not available on-site per system. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about larger formats. Looking up the latest information.
