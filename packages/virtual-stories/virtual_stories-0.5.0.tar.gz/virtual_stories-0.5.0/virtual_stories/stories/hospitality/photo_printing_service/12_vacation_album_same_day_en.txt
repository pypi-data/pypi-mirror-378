system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Photo printing up to 8x10 on glossy or matte; typical turnaround 15–30 minutes for up to 30 prints during 08:00–20:00 staffed hours. Submission via USB or email attachment; color correction is auto only.

user:
Can I get about 20 photos printed before dinner?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm capacity and turnaround; add small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—20 prints is right in the sweet spot. If you can send them by 18:30, we usually turn around 15–30 minutes. Choose glossy for pop or matte for a softer album look. USB or email both work—shall I reserve a slot?

user:
Can you print true borderless 6x8?

assistant channel=analysis:
Borderless specifics beyond context; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Great eye for detail. Assessing the sizing specifics.
