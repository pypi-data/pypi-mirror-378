system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Photo printing up to 8x10, glossy or matte; color laser letter/A4 for text cards. Turnaround 15–30 minutes for small batches during 08:00–20:00 staffed hours.

user:
Hi! We’re making thank-you cards. Which looks nicer—glossy or matte for photo inserts?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide on-site options with a brief aesthetic suggestion.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations! For cards, matte tends to pair beautifully with pen-written notes since it doesn’t smudge easily, while glossy gives more pop if the photo is the star. We can run a quick one-of-each test so you can compare in hand.

user:
Could you match a specific Pantone color for the envelopes?

assistant channel=analysis:
Pantone matching beyond system context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about Pantone matching. Researching available details.
