I've set aside an umbrella for room 847 - you can pick it up at the front desk. Please return it by 10:00 PM. For your solo adventure, I recommend starting with a coffee at Storyville Coffee (just a 10-minute walk) - their lattes are legendary. Then head to the Space Needle - it's even more magical in the mist!
