Hi there! I'm staying in room 512 and I'd like to prepare a healthy salad. What bowl options do you have that would work well for salads?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about bowl options for salad preparation. I should present all three options and highlight the bamboo bowl as being eco-friendly and lightweight, which might appeal to someone preparing a healthy salad.

assistant channel=final:
Hello! For salad preparation, we have three great options: porcelain bowls (16 oz), bamboo bowls (14 oz), and stainless steel bowls (18 oz). The bamboo bowls are particularly nice for salads - they're lightweight, eco-friendly, and have a natural feel. The porcelain bowls are also excellent for salads and are microwave-safe if you need to warm any ingredients. Which would you prefer?

user:
The bamboo bowl sounds perfect - I love that it's eco-friendly! Can you deliver one to room 512?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest has chosen the bamboo bowl and wants it delivered to room 512. I should confirm the delivery and provide timing information.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice! The bamboo bowl is indeed eco-friendly and perfect for salads. I'll arrange delivery to room 512 - it should arrive within 10-15 minutes. The bowl will be sanitized before delivery. Please leave it on the desk when you're finished - we'll collect it during evening turndown.

user:
Perfect! I'm really enjoying my stay here. The harbor view from my room is incredible.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is making small talk about enjoying their stay and the harbor view, which is mentioned in the system prompt. This is a nice chitchat moment that doesn't require any tools.

assistant channel=final:
I'm so glad you're enjoying your stay! Room 512 does have one of our best harbor views with those floor-to-ceiling windows. It's especially beautiful at sunset. Your bamboo bowl should be arriving shortly for your salad preparation!

user:
That sounds wonderful! Do you happen to know if there are any local farmers markets nearby where I could get fresh ingredients?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about local farmers markets, which goes beyond the system prompt information about hotel amenities and services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since I don't have access to local market information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about farmers markets. Searching for more information.

user:
No worries, I'll ask the concierge. Thanks for your help with the bowl!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is thanking me and ending the conversation. I should provide a friendly closing response.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! Enjoy your healthy salad with the beautiful harbor view. Have a wonderful day!
