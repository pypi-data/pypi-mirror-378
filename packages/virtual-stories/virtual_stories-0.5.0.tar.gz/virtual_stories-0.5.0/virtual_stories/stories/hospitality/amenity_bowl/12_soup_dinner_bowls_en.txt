user:
Hi, I'm in room 512 and I'd like to have some soup for dinner. What size bowls do you have available?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about bowl sizes for soup dinner. I need to provide information about the three available bowl sizes and their capacities, helping them choose the most appropriate option for soup.

assistant channel=final:
Hello! We have three bowl sizes available: porcelain bowls (16 oz), bamboo bowls (14 oz), and stainless steel bowls (18 oz). For soup, I'd recommend either the porcelain (16 oz) or stainless steel (18 oz) bowls as they're both microwave-safe for heating. Which size would work best for your soup dinner?

user:
The stainless steel bowl sounds perfect - 18 oz should be plenty for soup. Can you deliver it to room 512?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest has chosen the stainless steel bowl and wants it delivered to room 512. I should confirm the delivery and provide timing information.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! I'll arrange delivery of a stainless steel bowl (18 oz) to room 512. It should arrive within 10-15 minutes. The bowl will be sanitized before delivery. Please leave it on the desk when you're finished - we'll collect it during evening turndown.

user:
Perfect, thank you! By the way, I love the rope art in the lobby - it's really unique.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is making small talk about the lobby art, which is mentioned in the system prompt as a rope-art installation. This is a nice chitchat moment that doesn't require any tools or additional information.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! The rope-art installation in the lobby is one of our signature design elements - it gets quite a lot of compliments from guests. I'm glad you're enjoying it. Your stainless steel bowl should be arriving shortly!

user:
Great! One quick question - do you know if the hotel has any special events happening this weekend?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about weekend events at the hotel, which goes beyond the system prompt information about amenities and services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since I don't have access to event schedules or special programming information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about weekend events. Reviewing available resources.

user:
No problem, I'll check with the concierge. Thanks again for the bowl!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is thanking me and ending the conversation. I should provide a friendly closing response.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! Enjoy your soup dinner with the harbor view. Have a wonderful evening!
