I'm here for the wellness retreat and just realized I need some personal care items. Do you have tampons available?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is at our luxury spa resort for a wellness retreat and needs tampons. I should provide information about our organic cotton options and discreet delivery service, emphasizing our wellness-focused approach.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We provide organic cotton personal care items as part of our wellness amenities. I can arrange for hypoallergenic, fragrance-free tampons to be delivered discreetly to your spa suite. Would you prefer our standard organic cotton or our ultra-gentle bamboo fiber option?

user:
The bamboo fiber sounds perfect for my sensitive skin. How quickly can you get them here?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest prefers the bamboo fiber option and wants to know delivery time. I should provide specific timing and mention our wellness concierge service.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice - our bamboo fiber option is ideal for sensitive skin. Our wellness concierge can deliver them within 15 minutes. I'll also include our organic cotton wipes and our signature lavender-scented hand sanitizer to complete your wellness kit.

user:
That sounds wonderful. I'm really impressed with how thoughtful your wellness program is here.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is complimenting our wellness program. I should respond graciously and perhaps mention some of our other wellness offerings.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you so much! We believe wellness should be comprehensive and personalized. Our team of certified wellness practitioners has designed every aspect of your experience, from our organic cotton linens to our farm-to-table dining and daily meditation classes.

user:
Speaking of meditation, I'd love to try your sound healing ceremony I saw mentioned in the brochure.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about our sound healing ceremony, which is mentioned in our system prompt. I can provide information about this service.

assistant channel=final:
Our sound healing ceremonies are truly transformative experiences. We use Tibetan singing bowls, crystal bowls, and gongs to create healing frequencies. The sessions are held in our dedicated meditation pavilion with vineyard views, and our certified sound therapist guides participants through deep relaxation and energy balancing.

user:
That sounds amazing! When are the next sessions available?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about session availability, which would require checking schedules. This goes beyond what's provided in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'd be happy to check the current schedule for you. Reviewing available resources.
