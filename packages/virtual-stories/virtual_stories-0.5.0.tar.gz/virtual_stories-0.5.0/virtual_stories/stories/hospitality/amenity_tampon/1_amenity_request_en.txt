Hi, I have a bit of an emergency. Do you have any tampons you could send to my room?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user needs a tampon. I will use the `request_amenity` tool to provide one, and I will be discreet and professional.

{"amenity_name": "tampon", "quantity": 1}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A personal care item will be delivered to your room discreetly."}

Of course. I've arranged for a personal care item to be delivered to your room discreetly. It will arrive in a few minutes.

I'd like to know if you have a yoga class tomorrow morning.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about a yoga class. I do not have a tool for that. I will use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

[ATTENTION] I can certainly check that for you. Reviewing available resources.
