Hello! My kids have been swimming all day and need a gentle shower setup to get the pool water off. Can you configure something mild for sensitive skin?

Parent needs gentle shower setup for children after pool activities. This requires mild temperature settings and pool-specific amenities for sensitive skin.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! I'll set up a gentle shower configuration perfect for post-pool care. I'll configure the temperature to 100°F for comfort, set the handheld shower pressure to low for sensitive skin, and arrange pool-specific amenities including gentle body wash and conditioner to remove chlorine and salt water residue. What's your room number and how many children are we setting up for?

user:
Room 2156. We have 3 kids aged 5, 7, and 9. They've been in the pool for hours and their skin is getting sensitive.

Perfect! For your 3 children with sensitive skin after extended pool time, I'll set the shower temperature to 100°F with low handheld pressure. I'll arrange gentle body wash, conditioner, and moisturizer specifically designed to remove pool chemicals and soothe sensitive skin. The setup will be ready in room 2156 within 15 minutes, and I'll include extra towels for the children.
