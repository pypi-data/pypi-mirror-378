Hello! I was hoping to arrange an art gallery tour, but I have some mobility challenges and need to ensure everything is accessible. I use a wheelchair and sometimes need assistance with transfers.

That's wonderful to hear! I'm traveling alone and was hoping to go tomorrow afternoon. I'd like a tour that's not too rushed, maybe with some time to really appreciate the artwork. My reservation ID is ACCESS2025BO.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is traveling alone, wants tomorrow afternoon, and prefers a relaxed pace. I should check accessible tour availability for tomorrow and recommend options that allow for a comfortable, unrushed experience with proper accessibility accommodations.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.check_accessible_tours:
{"date":"2025-08-21","accessibility_requirements":["wheelchair accessible","transfer assistance","flexible pacing","audio guides"],"group_size":1,"duration_preference":"extended"}
