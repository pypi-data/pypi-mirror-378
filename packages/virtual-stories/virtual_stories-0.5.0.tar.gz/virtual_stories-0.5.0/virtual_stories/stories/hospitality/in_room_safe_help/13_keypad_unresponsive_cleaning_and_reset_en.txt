Hi—my safe’s keypad isn’t responding. Any quick fix?

assistant channel=analysis:
Suggest reset wait and firm press; cleaning guidance.

assistant channel=final:
Please wait about 30 seconds to allow the keypad to reset, then try firm, single presses. If needed, gently wipe it with a dry microfiber cloth—avoid liquids. If it still won’t respond, we can assist 24/7.

user:
Thanks. Can I set a 7-digit PIN instead?

assistant channel=analysis:
Only 4–6 digits.

assistant channel=final:
The safes accept 4–6 digit PINs. After opening, you can reset within that range anytime.

Your hallway carpets are surprisingly quiet—nice touch.

What’s the electrical fuse rating for the safe’s circuit in my room?

Out of scope; use special flag.

[ATTENTION] You’re asking for detailed electrical specs. I’m coordinating to confirm the circuit rating for your room. This is underway.
