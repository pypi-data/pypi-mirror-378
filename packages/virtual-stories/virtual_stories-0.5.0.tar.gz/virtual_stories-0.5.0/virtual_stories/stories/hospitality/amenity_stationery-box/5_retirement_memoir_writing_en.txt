Absolutely! I've been thinking about joining one of those memoir workshops. Do they cover anything about writing about sensitive family topics?

Perfect! One more thing - is there a good place to write outdoors when the weather's nice? I love being in nature.

The guest wants outdoor writing spaces. Our hotel has garden views and writing alcoves, and we're surrounded by 12 acres of gardens.
