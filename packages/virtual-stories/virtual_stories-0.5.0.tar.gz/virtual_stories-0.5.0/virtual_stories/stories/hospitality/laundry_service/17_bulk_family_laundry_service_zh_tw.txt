我們一家五口人需要洗很多衣物，有沒有大宗洗衣服務？

assistant channel=analysis:
客人一家五口需要大宗洗衣服務，這是我們飯店的強項。我需要介紹我們的家庭洗衣方案和折扣。

assistant channel=final:
當然有！我們有大宗洗衣方案：50磅以下15美元，51-100磅25美元，超過100磅35美元。包含免費洗劑、柔軟精和烘衣紙。您一家需要洗多少衣物呢？

user:
大概80磅左右。能不能告訴我你們的洗衣機容量？

assistant channel=analysis:
客人詢問洗衣機容量，這完全在我的系統知識範圍內。我可以分享我們的商業級洗衣設備。

assistant channel=final:
我們的洗衣中心有10台商業級洗衣機，每台容量25磅，還有8台工業烘乾機。還有家庭分類區和顏色編碼籃子。您的80磅衣物很適合我們的方案。

user:
很方便！請問你們的洗衣追蹤系統是如何運作的？

assistant channel=analysis:
客人詢問洗衣追蹤系統的運作方式，這超出我的系統知識範圍。我知道有手機App追蹤，但沒有具體運作細節。這需要使用ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT。

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] 我們的確有手機App提供洗衣追蹤服務。我正在查詢系統運作的詳細資訊。
