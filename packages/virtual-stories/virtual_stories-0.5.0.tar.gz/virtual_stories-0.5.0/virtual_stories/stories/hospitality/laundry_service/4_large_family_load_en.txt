That's great! The kids had so much fun skiing today. Your lodge is perfect for families—the game room is a hit!

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge the family's positive experience with the lodge. No tool needed for this response.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! We're thrilled to hear the kids enjoyed the skiing and game room. Our lodge was designed specifically for families, with ski-in/ski-out access and plenty of activities to keep everyone entertained after a day on the slopes. The game room is indeed a favorite!

user:
Yes, it's been wonderful. Could you recommend a good family-friendly restaurant in Vail for dinner tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Family is asking for restaurant recommendations. I can provide this information based on hotel knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
I'd recommend The Little Dipper right in Lionshead Village—it's just a short walk from the slopes. They have delicious burgers, pizza, and ice cream sundaes that the kids love, plus a great selection of adult entrees and local beers. The atmosphere is fun and family-oriented.
