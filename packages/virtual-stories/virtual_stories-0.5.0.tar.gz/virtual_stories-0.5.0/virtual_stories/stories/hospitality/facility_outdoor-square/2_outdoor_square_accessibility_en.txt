Hi! I'm staying at the hotel and I use a wheelchair. Can you tell me about the accessibility of your outdoor square? I'd like to know if I can easily get around there.

The guest is asking about wheelchair accessibility for the outdoor plaza. I should use the accessibility features tool to get detailed information about ramps, seating, and other accessibility features.

assistant channel=analysis:
I have comprehensive accessibility information. The plaza is well-designed for wheelchair users with ADA-compliant ramps, wide pathways, and accessible seating. I should provide a detailed but friendly response.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! Cedar Plaza is fully accessible and wheelchair-friendly. We have ADA-compliant ramps on all four sides with a gentle 1:12 slope, and the main pathway is 8 feet wide to ensure easy navigation. There are 8 wheelchair-accessible seating areas with 32-inch clearance, and one of our water fountains is specifically designed for wheelchair users at 34-inch height. The surface is non-slip concrete with decorative stone inlays, and we maintain tactile paving strips to guide visually impaired guests. The plaza is 2,400 square feet with multiple seating zones, so you'll have plenty of space to move around comfortably.

user:
That sounds great! What about the seating? Are there comfortable places to sit?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about seating comfort. I have information about the seating options from the system prompt and tool output. I should provide details about the different seating types available.

assistant channel=final:
We have several comfortable seating options! There are 24 moveable chairs that you can position wherever you'd like, plus 6 planters with integrated seating that provide a nice natural feel. The wheelchair-accessible seating areas are designed for comfort with proper clearance. During summer months (May-September), we have retractable shade sails to keep you cool, and in winter (November-March), we have heated seating areas. There are also 4 shade sail posts for additional coverage. All seating is designed to be both functional and comfortable for extended use.

user:
Perfect! I'm planning to spend some time there tomorrow morning. What time does it open?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about opening hours. This information is available in the system prompt - the plaza operates from 06:00-23:00 daily.

assistant channel=final:
Cedar Plaza opens at 6:00 AM and stays open until 11:00 PM daily. Tomorrow morning would be perfect - it's usually quiet and peaceful in the early hours, and you'll have the whole space to yourself to enjoy the morning air and comfortable seating.

user:
That's wonderful! One more question - I heard you have some kind of misting system for hot weather?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the misting system. This information is in the system prompt under seasonal features - the misting system operates from June-August.

assistant channel=final:
Yes! We have a misting system that operates during the summer months from June through August. It provides a refreshing cool mist that makes the plaza much more comfortable during hot weather. The system is designed to be gentle and not interfere with seating or activities, so you can enjoy the cooling effect while relaxing in the plaza.

user:
That sounds amazing! I can't wait to check it out tomorrow morning.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is expressing enthusiasm and seems satisfied with the information. This is a simple, positive response that doesn't require any tools or additional information.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful! I'm sure you'll love spending time in Cedar Plaza. It's a beautiful space that's designed to be comfortable and accessible for all our guests. Enjoy your morning there tomorrow!

user:
Actually, I'm curious about something else - do you have any information about local accessibility resources or services in the area?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about local accessibility resources beyond what's available at the hotel. This information is not provided in the system prompt or available through our tools, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'm looking into this for you.
