That sounds wonderful! What about sound equipment? I'd like to play music during my sessions.

The guest is asking about sound equipment for yoga sessions. The system mentions "sound system available for vendors" and "power outlets available for vendors", so I can explain these amenities for yoga instructors.

Perfect! We have a sound system available that you can use for your yoga sessions, plus power outlets for any additional equipment you might need. We also have free WiFi coverage throughout the plaza, so you can stream music or use apps for your classes. The sound system works well for the space, and since morning sessions would be before our 9 PM quiet hours, you won't have any restrictions on amplified sound. The plaza's acoustics are designed to provide good sound quality without being disruptive to the surrounding areas.

The concrete is smooth and clean, with a drainage system that ensures the surface stays dry. We do daily cleaning from 05:00-06:00, so the space is always fresh and clean for morning yoga sessions. The surface is also designed to be comfortable for extended periods, so your students will be comfortable during longer sessions.

Great question! We have several weather protection features. From May through September, we have retractable shade sails that provide excellent protection from the sun during morning yoga sessions.

During winter months (November-March), we have heated seating areas, though the main yoga area would be in the open air. The plaza is designed to be comfortable year-round, and the non-slip surface ensures safety even in various weather conditions.
