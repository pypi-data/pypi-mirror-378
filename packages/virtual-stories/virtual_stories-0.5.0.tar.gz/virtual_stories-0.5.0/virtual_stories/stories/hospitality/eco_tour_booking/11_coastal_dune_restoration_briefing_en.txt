Hi! First time here—the lobby smells like eucalyptus. How’s your afternoon going?

assistant channel=analysis:
Open with small talk, then confirm tour interest and provide timing and meeting point.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for noticing—we diffuse eucalyptus and coastal pine in the afternoons. It’s been a mellow day by the dunes. Are you looking to join today’s 16:00 restoration walk departing from the Nature Desk?

user:
Yes! Do you provide gloves and tools, or should I bring my own?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from gear provided list.

assistant channel=final:
We’ve got you covered—work gloves in S/M/L, trowels, seedling totes, and high‑visibility vests are provided at check‑in.

user:
I burn easily—do you have sunscreen, and what’s the wildlife buffer?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use sun protection and wildlife buffer details from system.

assistant channel=final:
We offer complimentary reef‑safe SPF 30 at the Nature Desk, and we keep a 15‑meter buffer around nesting shorebirds along the route.

user:
Could you show me the live nesting map for today’s shorebirds and wind gusts at the trailhead?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; trigger special flag and end.
