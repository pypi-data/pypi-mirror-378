user:
Hello! Could you split our king into two twins and swap any down items? I’m allergic.

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer hypoallergenic pillows and duvet alternatives; confirm timing.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—we can reconfigure to two twins and switch to hypoallergenic pillows with a cotton blanket and microfiber layer instead of down. We handle these between 10:00 and 16:00; turndown runs 18:00–20:00 if you prefer the change then.

user:
Thanks so much. Are the microfiber layers OEKO‑TEX certified?

assistant channel=analysis:
