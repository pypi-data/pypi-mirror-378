Thank you so much. This has been such a stressful morning. Is there a pharmacy nearby?

I understand this must be very difficult for you. We have pharmacy delivery service available, and there's also a 24-hour pharmacy just 5 minutes away. Would you like me to arrange delivery?

Can you also arrange for a wheelchair to be ready at the entrance when we arrive?
