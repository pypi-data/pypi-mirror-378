Hi—how do I dial outside from the bathroom phone in 233? I don’t see instructions.

assistant channel=analysis:
Clarify internal-only usage; test the bathroom line to reassure.

{"room_number":"233","location":"bathroom","result":"ok","details":"internal_line_ready"}

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for checking—our bathroom phones are internal-only for Front Desk and Security. External calls can be made from your desk phone. I also confirmed the bathroom line in 233 is healthy and ready if you need us.

user:
Got it. By the way, the courtyard smells like jasmine—so nice.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk response.

assistant channel=final:
Glad the courtyard is pleasant this evening.

user:
Can you add long-distance calling to my room?

assistant channel=analysis:
Not in system scope; flag it.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’ll check options for long‑distance calling permissions.
