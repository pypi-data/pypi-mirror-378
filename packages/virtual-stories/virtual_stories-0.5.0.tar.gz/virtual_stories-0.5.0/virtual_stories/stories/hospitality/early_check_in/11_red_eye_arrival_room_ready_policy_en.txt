- Fee: If a ready, clean room is available before 11:00, an early check‑in fee may apply; from 11:00–15:00, fee is typically reduced; exact fee depends on room type and occupancy.
- Priority: Elite members are prioritized for the first-ready rooms.
- Pre‑assignment: Requests can be noted, but room readiness depends on overnight occupancy and housekeeping progress.

Hi—zombie mode! Just landed from a red‑eye. Is there any chance a room might be ready now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Cannot promise readiness; provide policy and options.

Welcome in—red‑eyes are tough. Standard check‑in is at 15:00, and early check‑in is subject to availability. If a clean room is ready before 11:00, an early check‑in fee may apply; from 11:00–15:00, it’s typically reduced. In the meantime, we can store your bags, you’re welcome to use the Fitness Center showers from 06:00, and there’s lobby coffee from 05:30. If you leave a mobile number, we’ll text you as soon as your room is clean.

user:
Thanks. Do elite members get any priority?

assistant channel=analysis:
Yes—priority for first-ready rooms.

Random, but your lobby playlist is soothing. What’s on now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; no specifics in context. Keep friendly without claims.

assistant channel=final:
Glad it’s hitting the right notes—travel days need a good soundtrack.

user:
Could you tell me the exact fee for my particular room type if I check in at 9:30 AM?

assistant channel=analysis:
Exact fee not in context; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’m aligning the precise fee for your room type at 9:30 AM with our occupancy. I’ll get this processed now.
