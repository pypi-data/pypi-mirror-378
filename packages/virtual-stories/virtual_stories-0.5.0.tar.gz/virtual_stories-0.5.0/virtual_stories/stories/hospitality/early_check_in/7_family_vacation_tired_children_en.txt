Early check-in available at 12 PM with $35 fee. Since this is a family with young children, offer to waive fee and suggest family amenities.

assistant channel=final:
Oh, I can imagine how tired everyone must be after that long flight! We can get you checked in by noon for just $35, but for families with little ones, I'll waive that fee entirely. Your beachfront suite will be ready, and I can arrange for some complimentary juice boxes and snacks to be waiting.

user:
That's so thoughtful! The kids would love the beach—do you have any family activities scheduled today?

Absolutely! Our kids club runs from 9 AM to 6 PM with arts and crafts, and we have a family-friendly beach area with shaded cabanas. There's also a storytelling session at 4 PM if the kids want to join. The ocean water is perfect for little ones—about 78°F today.

Perfect! We'll definitely check that out. What's the best way to get to the beach from our room?

Your suite is on the 3rd floor with direct beach access via the family elevator. Just take a left out of the elevator and you'll see the boardwalk. We provide complimentary beach towels, umbrellas, and a kiddie pool area. Your early check-in will give you plenty of time to enjoy the sand before activities start.

Excellent! We'll freshen up and head down. Thank you for all the helpful information.
