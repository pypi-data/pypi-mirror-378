user:
The standard video setup should be fine, but could you make sure there are extra power outlets for our devices? We'll have multiple laptops and tablets that need charging during the meeting.

Of course! I'll have our team add extra power outlets and charging stations around the conference table. We'll also prepare backup power banks just in case. Your meeting should run smoothly without any technical interruptions.
