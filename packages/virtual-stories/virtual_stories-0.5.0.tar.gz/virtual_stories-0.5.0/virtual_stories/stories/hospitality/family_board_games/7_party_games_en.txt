What Do You Meme sounds like it would get everyone laughing! We're celebrating a family reunion, so humor is definitely welcome. I'll borrow that for the Johnson reunion group.

Fantastic choice! What Do You Meme? is legendary for family reunionsâ€”it gets everyone from grandparents to grandkids laughing together. I've included extra caption cards and even a celebration playlist to set the mood.

Your family will be creating memes that will be talked about for years!

user:
That's perfect! The playlist will really set the mood. What's the most popular game for family reunions at your resort?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about popular reunion games. This is small talk about celebration activities - no tool needed. Share resort's experience with family gatherings.

assistant channel=final:
What Do You Meme? is definitely number one for reunions! But we also love:

**Two Truths and a Lie** - Great for getting to know family members better
**Family Feud** - Customizable with family-specific questions
**Minute to Win It** - Quick physical challenges that get everyone moving
**Themed Trivia** - Family history or inside jokes make it extra special

We often help families customize games with their own photos and stories. It makes the celebration truly unique!

Enjoy your meme-making reunion. You're going to have a blast!
