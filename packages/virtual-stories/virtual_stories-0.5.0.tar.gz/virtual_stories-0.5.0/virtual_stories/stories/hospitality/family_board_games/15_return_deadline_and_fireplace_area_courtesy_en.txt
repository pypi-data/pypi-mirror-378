Hi again! We’re finishing a long match—how’s your night winding down?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk, then return reminder.

assistant channel=final:
It’s been a cheerful evening—thanks! When you’re done, returns are due by 22:30 so we can sanitize the sets.

We’re near the fireplace—any courtesy tips?

assistant channel=analysis:
Mention mixed seating and courtesy.
