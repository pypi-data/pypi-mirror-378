Seabreeze Hotel – Wine Week: Quiet hours 22:00–07:00; glassware from bar until 21:30; lobby tasting 17:30–19:00; water station adjacent.

user:
We want to enjoy a glass on the balcony later—any suggestions?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer within policy; small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Consider a lighter pour after the lobby tasting, with water to pace. Our bar can provide glassware until 21:30—perfect for a calm balcony moment before quiet hours at 22:00. Leaning red or white tonight?

user:
White! Can the bar send a bottle at 21:45?

assistant channel=analysis:
Bar glassware cutoff 21:30; stay factual.

assistant channel=final:
The bar handles glassware service until 21:30. If you’d like to settle in earlier, we can have everything ready before then.

user:
Could you forward the vineyard’s disgorgement dates and lot codes for the sparkling flight?
