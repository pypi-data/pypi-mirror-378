Hello! I brought my own family heirloom chopsticks from home, but I'm worried about keeping them properly clean during my stay. They're lacquered and quite old—probably from the 1940s. What's the best way to maintain them?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest has valuable antique lacquered chopsticks. Provide specialized care instructions for vintage items.

assistant channel=final:
For 1940s lacquered chopsticks, hand-wash gently with lukewarm water and mild soap after each use—never soak or use a dishwasher. Dry immediately with a soft cloth, then air-dry completely. Monthly mineral oil treatment helps preserve the lacquer. Store in a dry location away from heat sources. Would you like our professional restoration cleaning service as extra protection?

user:
