Good evening! I have a severe bamboo allergy and noticed the in-room chopsticks are bamboo. Could you provide safe alternatives? I'm in room 847.

I can help with that right away. We have titanium surgical-grade (hypoallergenic), medical-grade silicone (FDA-approved), and certified bamboo-free hardwoods including maple, cherry, and walnut. All are lab-tested and come with certification cards. Which material would you prefer for room 847?

The titanium sounds perfect—lightweight and hypoallergenic is exactly what I need. How quickly can you get those to me?
