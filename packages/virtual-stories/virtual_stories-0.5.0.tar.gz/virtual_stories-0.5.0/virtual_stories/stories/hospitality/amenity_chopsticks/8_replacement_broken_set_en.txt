Hi, I'm in room 1847 and just broke one of the lacquered chopsticks that came with my dinner. The tip snapped off. Can you send a replacement quickly? I'm in the middle of eating.

Perfect timing, thank you! By the way, does your hotel offer any cultural dining workshops?

assistant channel=analysis:
Cultural workshops are outside the replacement service tools and scope—use attention flag.
