All are sourced from artisan families and include cultural history cards by Dr. Susan Kim. Which regions interest you most?

This resort really celebrates authentic culture. How did you develop such an extensive collection?

assistant channel=analysis:
Share our cultural authentication process and artisan partnerships as this relates to our cultural mission.

assistant channel=final:
We've built relationships directly with artisan families since 1995—the Yoshida workshop in Kyoto, Chen family woodworkers in Hangzhou, and Park metalworks in Seoul. Each piece comes with provenance certificates, and the Vancouver Asian Cultural Centre helps verify our authentication. Our resident cultural ambassadors ensure we honor traditional practices correctly.

user:
Could you arrange for us to meet with one of those visiting chefs you mentioned for a private cooking lesson?

assistant channel=analysis:
Private chef arrangements and cooking lessons are beyond the chopsticks delivery tools—use attention flag.

[ATTENTION] I'd love to help with chef arrangements. Looking into our visiting chef program.
