Hi! Which option is closest to our current soft pillow but a bit taller?

assistant channel=analysis:
Suggest Cooling Gel Foam at scale 3 for more loft than softest.

assistant channel=final:
Cooling Gel Foam (scale 3) adds height while staying softer than Memory Foam.

Can I keep both the old and new pillows overnight?

Limit is max 2 additional per room—within limit, yes.

Yes—you may keep both overnight as long as the total added pillows remain within the 2-per-room limit.
