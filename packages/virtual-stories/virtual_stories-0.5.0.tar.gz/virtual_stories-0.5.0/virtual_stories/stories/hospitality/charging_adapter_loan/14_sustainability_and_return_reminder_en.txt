Hi! Quick question before coffee—do you reuse the adapters between guests?

Explain recirculation and cleaning.

assistant channel=final:
Good morning! Yes—we clean returned adapters and recirculate them. We also remind guests at checkout to drop them off so they can go back into rotation.

You can return to the Front Desk any time, or to the Tech Kiosk between 07:00–22:00—whichever is easier.
