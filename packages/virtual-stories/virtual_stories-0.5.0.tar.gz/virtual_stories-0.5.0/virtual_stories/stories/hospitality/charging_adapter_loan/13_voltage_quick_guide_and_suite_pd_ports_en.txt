Hello! Hope your evening’s peaceful. Do you have a simple voltage guide I can look at?

assistant channel=analysis:
Yes per system; provide availability.

assistant channel=final:
It is, thank you! We do have a laminated “voltage quick guide.” I can have one sent up or ready at the Front Desk for pickup.

user:
My laptop’s 100–240V. Are your suites’ USB-C ports good enough to top it off?

assistant channel=analysis:
Suites USB-C PD 30W; explain suitability.

assistant channel=final:
Our suites provide bedside USB‑C Power Delivery at 30W. It’s fine for topping off many laptops, though high‑wattage charging will still need your own charger.

user:
Could you confirm the exact wattage on floor hub USB-C and where the closest one is to 1208?

assistant channel=analysis:
USB-C 20W; floors include 12 so near 1208.

assistant channel=final:
The hubs offer USB‑C at 20W. Since you’re on 12, the hub on floor 12 is the closest.

user:
Nice. Also—can you tell me which electronics store in town has the lowest price on a 65W GaN charger tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; use special flag and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Checking available options.
