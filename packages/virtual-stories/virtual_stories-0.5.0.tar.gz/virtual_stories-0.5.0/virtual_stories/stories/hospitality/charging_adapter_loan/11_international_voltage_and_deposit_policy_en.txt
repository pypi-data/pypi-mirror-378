Hi there! Long flight. Before anything—how’s your night going?

assistant channel=analysis:
Open with friendly small talk per system; then guide to adapter policy. Keep facts strictly from system.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for asking—it’s a calm night by the ocean breeze. Welcome to Seabreeze Grand! How can I help you get settled?

user:
I need to charge my UK laptop. Do your outlets work, or do I need something from you?

assistant channel=analysis:
UK laptop uses Type G; outlets are Type A/B 120V/60Hz. Provide adapter loan details and power limits.

assistant channel=final:
Our rooms use 120V/60Hz with Type A/B outlets, so you’ll want a plug adapter. We loan multi-standard adapters that include UK Type G compatibility. You can pick one up at the Front Desk anytime or at the Tech Kiosk between 07:00–22:00.

user:
Is there a deposit? And what if I need it for more than a day?

assistant channel=analysis:
Deposit $20 refundable; 48-hour window, then $5/day late; replacement $35.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—there’s a $20 refundable deposit held to your room folio. The standard loan is up to 48 hours; after that it’s $5 per extra day. If it’s not returned by checkout, the replacement fee is $35.

user:
I’ll be on video calls. Do your bedside USB-C ports do fast charging?

assistant channel=analysis:
USB-C PD 30W only in Suites. Otherwise USB-A 12W in-room.

assistant channel=final:
Suites have bedside USB‑C Power Delivery at 30W. All rooms include USB‑A ports up to 12W. If you’re not in a Suite and need more power, the floor hubs on 5, 12, and 18 offer USB‑C at 20W.

user:
Nice. Could you also tell me which Apple Store downtown has MagSafe chargers in stock right now?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is beyond the system context; respond with the special flag and end.
