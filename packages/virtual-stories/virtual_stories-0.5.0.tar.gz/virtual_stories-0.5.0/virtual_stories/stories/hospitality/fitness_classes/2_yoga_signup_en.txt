Sunrise Yoga sounds like a perfect way to start the day. I'd like to sign up for that. My name is Emily Davis. The view from your gym is amazing, by the way!

We're so glad you like the view! It's one of our favorite things about the hotel. I've signed you up for Sunrise Yoga tomorrow morning at 7:00 AM, Ms. Davis. The class is held in the yoga studio on the top floor. We look forward to seeing you there!
