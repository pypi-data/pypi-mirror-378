Could I return the mat a day late? The fireplace is so cozy I might linger tomorrow.

Affirm fireplace; explain no waivers, offer renewal tomorrow; proceed with 1 mat today due 2025-09-17.

The fire does draw you in. We don’t waive the 24‑hour due time, but you can renew tomorrow with a quick note. Shall I check out one mat for today, due 2025-09-17?
