Do you have any evening or nighttime photography options?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about evening and nighttime photography. I have information about our light painting sessions and evening photography opportunities that I can share.

assistant channel=final:
Evening and nighttime photography is absolutely spectacular here! We offer light painting sessions where colored lights illuminate the mineral waters in beautiful hues, creating dreamlike effects in the steam. Our extended evening hours allow for sunset shots with the warm light filtering through the mist. For nighttime, we have subtle lighting that creates a magical atmosphere without being intrusive. Many of our most striking photographs are taken during golden hour or at dusk when the steam creates natural diffusion effects. It's truly breathtaking!

user:
What if I want to hire a professional photographer? Do you have recommendations?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for professional photographer recommendations. While I have information about our photography services and professional photography stations, specific recommendations for external photographers or current availability of our professional services would require checking current partnerships and schedules.
