Delivery: 10–20 minutes; collection on departure day.

user:
Hi, can you confirm if you’ve got pillows safe for a latex allergy?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from system; suggest microfiber or buckwheat; offer latex‑free protector; small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for checking in—comfort should be worry‑free. We do not use latex in pillow cores. For extra caution, we can fit a latex‑free protector (our older protectors with elastic were replaced in 2024). Hypoallergenic microfiber works well for many guests; buckwheat hull is also available if you like adjustable fill. I can send both for you to try in 10–20 minutes.

user:
Let’s try buckwheat and a microfiber. Do you have allergen covers too?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide allergen covers info.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we can add allergen covers laundered at 60°C. I’ll tag them for your room so housekeeping keeps that setup for the stay.

user:
Great. By the way, what’s the humidity like in the room right now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Good question for sleep comfort. Verifying information.
