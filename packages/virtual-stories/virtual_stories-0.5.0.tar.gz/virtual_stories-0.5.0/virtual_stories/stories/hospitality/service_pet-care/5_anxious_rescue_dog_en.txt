My rescue dog Luna was abused and gets very anxious around strangers. She's never been on vacation before and I'm worried about walks with unfamiliar people.

Could she start with just 15 minutes to see how she handles it?

assistant channel=analysis:
Owner wants to start small with 15 minutes which is perfect for gradual exposure.

Absolutely - 15 minutes is perfect for starting gently. We use gradual exposure therapy, so we'll move at Luna's pace and comfort level.

The aromatherapy gardens must be so peaceful for healing.

Chitchat about aromatherapy gardens - can share system info about calming plants like lavender and chamomile.

Yes, our aromatherapy gardens feature lavender, chamomile, and other calming plants specifically chosen for their therapeutic properties.

Can the walker meet us at a private entrance instead of the busy lobby?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest asking about private entrance which system mentions is available to minimize stranger exposure.

assistant channel=final:
Of course! We use private entrances near your room to minimize exposure to strangers and reduce anxiety triggers for sensitive pets.

What if Luna gets overwhelmed during the walk?

[ATTENTION] Let me coordinate a consultation appointment with our animal behaviorist to discuss Luna's specific needs and comfort strategies.
