user:
Hi! I'm really focused on my health and hydration. Do you have any wellness water options that can help with optimal hydration?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is focused on health and hydration. This aligns perfectly with our wellness resort's focus on optimal hydration. I should recommend a hydration plan and provide wellness water options.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! At Vitality Springs, we specialize in wellness hydration. What type of activities are you planning during your stay - are you more sedentary, moderately active, or quite athletic? This helps me recommend the best hydration approach.

user:
I'm fairly active - I plan to hike and do yoga classes. I also want to support my overall wellness goals.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is active with hiking and yoga, and has wellness goals. I should create a personalized hydration plan and recommend appropriate wellness waters.

{"guest_activity_level": "active", "health_goals": ["overall_wellness", "energy_support"], "climate_adaptation": "desert_heat"}

{"daily_intake": "3.5_liters", "water_types": ["electrolyte_enhanced", "alkaline"], "timing": ["morning", "pre_activity", "post_activity"], "supplements": ["trace_minerals", "vitamins"]}

assistant channel=analysis:
I have a personalized hydration plan. I should explain it and offer to provide the recommended wellness waters.

assistant channel=final:
For your active lifestyle in our desert climate, I recommend 3.5 liters daily with electrolyte-enhanced water for your hikes and alkaline water for recovery. Would you like me to set up daily delivery of these wellness waters to your room?

user:
Yes, please! That sounds perfect for my wellness routine. What's in the electrolyte-enhanced water?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to know about the electrolyte-enhanced water composition. This is detailed wellness information I have in my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Our electrolyte-enhanced water includes naturally sourced minerals like potassium, magnesium, and sodium, plus trace electrolytes for optimal cellular hydration. It's especially beneficial for active individuals in warm climates, helping maintain energy levels and prevent dehydration.

user:
That's impressive! Arizona's desert environment really makes hydration important. By the way, what's your favorite wellness activity here?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about wellness activities. This doesn't require specific information from my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! Arizona's desert climate indeed emphasizes the importance of proper hydration. I don't have personal favorites since I focus on wellness coordination, but our guests enjoy the various wellness activities available throughout the resort.

user:
Actually, I was wondering about the history of wellness resorts in Arizona and how the focus on hydration developed.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the history of wellness resorts in Arizona, which is detailed historical information not available in my basic system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research Arizona wellness resort history for you.

assistant channel=analysis:
I should offer alternative assistance while the information is being gathered.

assistant channel=final:
While I look into that, I can tell you that Arizona has been a wellness destination since the early 20th century. If you'd like, I can provide information about current wellness programs or arrange a hydration consultation with our nutritionist.
