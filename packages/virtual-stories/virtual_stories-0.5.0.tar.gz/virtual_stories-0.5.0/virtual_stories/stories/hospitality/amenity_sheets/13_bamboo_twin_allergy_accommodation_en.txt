Hi, I have severe allergies and need hypoallergenic sheets for my twin beds. I'm in room 3208.

Guest has allergies and needs bamboo_eco twin sheets. This requires special hypoallergenic service with sealed packaging and fragrance-free handling.

assistant channel=final:
I'll arrange hypoallergenic bamboo eco sheets for both twin beds in room 3208. These are naturally hypoallergenic and antimicrobial. I'll ensure they're delivered in sealed packaging with fragrance-free handling. The delivery will take about 30 minutes due to our special allergy protocols. Would you also like hypoallergenic pillows and dust mite-proof mattress covers?

Yes, that would be wonderful. What hypoallergenic pillow options do you have?
