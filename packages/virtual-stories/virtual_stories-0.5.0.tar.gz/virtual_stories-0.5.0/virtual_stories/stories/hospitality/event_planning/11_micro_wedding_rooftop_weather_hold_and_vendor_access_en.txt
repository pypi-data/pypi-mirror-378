Hi! We’re aiming for a sunrise ceremony—can we hold the rooftop and decide closer to the time if fog rolls in?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use weather hold window and decision timing.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we can place a 90-minute weather hold with the decision call at T-120 minutes. If morning fog persists, your indoor backup is Bayview Salon B, and we can flip the ceremony setup there promptly.

user:
Our florist asked about load-in—can they use the passenger elevator if freight is busy?

assistant channel=analysis:
Freight elevator windows and Dock 2 procedure.

assistant channel=final:
We prioritize the freight elevator for vendors 08:00–10:30 and 14:00–16:00. Load-in is through Dock 2, where we’ll provide carts. Passenger elevators are reserved for guests; exceptions are rare due to traffic.

user:
By the way, the lobby mosaic is beautiful—does it depict the old harbor map?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk acknowledgment without inventing new facts.

assistant channel=final:
I’m glad you noticed—it’s meant to evoke the harbor’s contours and colors for arriving guests.

user:
Is the city issuing extended rooftop amplified sound permits past 21:30 for weddings this month?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system context (city permits). Special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for checking on late amplified sound permissions. This is being coordinated with the appropriate contacts for clarity.
