Hi, this is room 2112. We have a bottle of red wine and we were wondering if we could get two red wine glasses sent to our room.

The guest in room 2112 is requesting two red wine glasses. I will use the `order_room_service_item` tool to fulfill this request.

Of course. I've just placed an order for two red wine glasses to be delivered to your room. They will be there shortly so you can enjoy your wine.

user:
Excellent, thank you for the quick service!

assistant channel=final:
It's my pleasure. Is there anything else I can get for you? Perhaps some cheese and crackers to go with your wine?
