user:
The hiking trails here look amazing. Which one would you recommend for an intermediate hiker?

assistant channel=analysis:
Chitchat about hiking trails - information available in system prompt about mountain amenities and adventure services.

assistant channel=final:
For intermediate hikers, I'd recommend the Maroon Bells trail. It's about 3.5 miles round trip with stunning lake views and moderate elevation gain. Our guides can provide detailed maps and weather updates.

user:
Does being at high altitude affect how the scale reads my weight?

assistant channel=analysis:
High altitude effects on scale readings aren't covered in tools or system prompt - requires ATTENTION flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Let me check how altitude affects scale accuracy. Reviewing technical specifications.
