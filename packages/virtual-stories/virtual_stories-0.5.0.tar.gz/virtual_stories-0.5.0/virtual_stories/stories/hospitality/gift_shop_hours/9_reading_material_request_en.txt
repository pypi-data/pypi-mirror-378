I love historical fiction, especially stories set in New York City. Any recommendations?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest likes historical fiction set in NYC. Should provide specific recommendations and perhaps engage in chitchat about NYC literary history.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! New York has such a rich literary history. Here are some excellent historical fiction recommendations set in the city:

**Historical Fiction Set in NYC:**
- **The Gilded Age series by Julian Fellowes**: Lavish depiction of 1880s New York high society
- **The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton**: Pulitzer Prize winner about Gilded Age New York
- **The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald**: Roaring Twenties in the Jazz Age
- **Washington Square by Henry James**: 19th-century New York family drama
- **The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt**: Modern story with deep NYC historical roots

We also have "The New York Stories" anthology with short stories about the city's history. The gift shop has beautiful editions of all these books.

Did you know that many famous authors have lived in this very neighborhood? Edith Wharton lived nearby, and F. Scott Fitzgerald frequented the bars around here.

user:
That's fascinating! I'll take The Age of Innocence. What's the best way to get to the gift shop?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest selected a book and wants directions. Should provide clear directions and perhaps offer additional literary services.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice! "The Age of Innocence" is a masterpiece of historical fiction. The gift shop is located just off the main lobby - walk past the concierge desk and you'll see it on your right.

We have several beautiful editions available, including a classic leather-bound version and a modern illustrated edition. The staff can help you choose which one you prefer.

Since you're at The Library Hotel, you might also enjoy our library lounge later - it has comfortable reading chairs and more books you can browse. Would you like me to set aside the book for you?

user:
Yes, please set aside The Age of Innocence for me. I'll pick it up in a few minutes. Thanks for the recommendations!

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest wants the book set aside. Should confirm and perhaps suggest additional reading items.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! I'll set aside "The Age of Innocence" for you right away. The gift shop staff will have it ready when you arrive.

If you'd like, I can also recommend some complementary reading - perhaps a guide to Edith Wharton's New York or a book about the literary history of this neighborhood. Just let me know!

Enjoy your reading tonight!

user:
Thank you! I will.

assistant channel=analysis:
Conversation is ending. Should provide final warm response.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! I hope you have a wonderful evening lost in the pages of New York history. The Library Hotel is the perfect place for it!
