Everything sounds amazing! I'm especially interested in the chocolates and preserves. What's your favorite Charleston treat?

Guest wants recommendations and personal favorites. This is chitchat that doesn't require a tool - I can share personal insights and recommendations.

assistant channel=final:
Oh, you can't go wrong with either! The chocolates are incredible - Charleston has a long tradition of chocolate making dating back to colonial times.

**My Personal Favorites:**
- **Magnolia's Chocolate Pralines**: Buttery, nutty, and perfectly sweet
- **Palmetto Islands Chocolate Truffles**: Rich and creamy with local flavors
- **Slightly North of Broad Preserves**: Especially the fig jam - it's like eating a piece of Southern summer

For the preserves, I recommend the red pepper jelly - it's great on crackers or as a glaze. The tea blends are also exceptional, especially the Charleston Breakfast Tea with hints of bergamot and local herbs.

Would you like me to put together a "Charleston Taste of Home" assortment with a selection of these items?

user:
Yes, that sounds perfect! Could you create a gift basket with chocolates, preserves, and the tea?

- **Artisan Crackers**: Perfect for enjoying the preserves

I'll include a note about each item's Charleston connection and how to enjoy them. The basket will be beautifully packaged and ready in about 20 minutes.
