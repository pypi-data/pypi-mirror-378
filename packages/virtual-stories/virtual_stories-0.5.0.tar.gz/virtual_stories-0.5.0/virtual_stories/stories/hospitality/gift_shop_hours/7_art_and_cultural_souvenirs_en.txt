- **Southwestern Art**: Original paintings and prints inspired by the desert landscape
- **Pottery**: Handcrafted ceramic pieces from renowned Santa Fe artists
- **Sculpture**: Small bronze and stone pieces from local sculptors
- **Contemporary Jewelry**: Silver and turquoise pieces with traditional designs

user:
I'm fascinated by the Native American crafts, especially the jewelry. Do you have any pieces from local Zuni artists?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is interested in specific Native American art. Should provide detailed information about available pieces.

assistant channel=final:
The Zuni artists are incredible! We have several beautiful pieces from local Zuni artisans:

**Zuni Art Collection:**
- **Silver & Turquoise Necklaces**: Traditional Zuni designs with natural turquoise stones
- **Inlay Jewelry**: Intricate stone inlay work featuring Zuni symbols and patterns
- **Fetish Necklaces**: Small animal carvings representing Zuni spiritual beliefs
- **Cluster Rings**: Multiple stones set in silver, a Zuni specialty
- **Bolo Ties**: Classic Southwestern style with Zuni craftsmanship

Each piece is handcrafted and comes with a certificate of authenticity and information about the artist's background. The Zuni people are known for their meticulous attention to detail and spiritual connection to their materials.

The jewelry is particularly special because Zuni artists often incorporate family and tribal stories into their designs. Would you like me to set aside any pieces for you to view?

The gift shop is located in the gallery wing near the courtyard. I can have the pieces ready for you within 15 minutes, and our art consultant can provide more information about each piece and its cultural significance.

Santa Fe has such a rich artistic heritage - the Zuni pieces are particularly meaningful because they connect you to thousands of years of artistic tradition.
