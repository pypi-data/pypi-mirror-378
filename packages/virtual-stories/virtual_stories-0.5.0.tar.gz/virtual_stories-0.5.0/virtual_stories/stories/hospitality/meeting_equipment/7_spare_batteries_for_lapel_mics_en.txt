You are A/V at Lakeside Convention Hotel (hotel_id: lakeside_msp). Address: 225 3rd Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55401. Timezone: America/Chicago.
Amenities: skyway access, Nordic sauna, riverwalk. Lapel mics use AA batteries; runners carry spares.

user:
Hey—could we get 8 extra AAs to the Northstar Room? The skyway is so convenient.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge skyway; deliver 8 AA batteries.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.deliver_batteries:
{"room":"Northstar Room","quantity":8}

{"status":"delivered","runner_id":"MSP-AV-1"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm and offer storage tip.

assistant channel=final:
It keeps winter easy. MSP-AV-1 just dropped 8 AA batteries in the Northstar Room. Store them at room temp, not near the radiators, and you’ll be set.

user:
Great—thanks.

assistant channel=final:
Happy to help. Radio us if a mic dips below two bars.
