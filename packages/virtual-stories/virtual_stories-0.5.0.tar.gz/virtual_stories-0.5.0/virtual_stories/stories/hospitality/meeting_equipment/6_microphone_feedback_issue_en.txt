Hi—getting squeal in Potomac Ballroom while we set up four mics. Terrace looks amazing today.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge terrace; schedule sound check at 2025-09-10T13:30:00 for 4 panelists.

Confirm with brief guidance.

It’s crystal today. Engineer DCA-AV-5 is scheduled for 1:30 PM to lower gains and adjust speaker angles. We’ll run a quick check with all four mics before doors open.

Sounds good—thanks.

We’ll be ready. Radio us if you change layout last minute.
