I'm hosting a small meeting in my suite tomorrow, and I need a projector and a whiteboard. Is that something you can provide?

We have the requested equipment. I will now inform the user and ask for their name to arrange for the delivery.

assistant channel=final:
Yes, we can certainly provide a projector and a whiteboard for your meeting. We also have conference phones and easels available if you need them. Could you please tell me your name so I can arrange for the equipment to be brought to your suite?

user:
That's great. My name is David Garcia. Just the projector and whiteboard will be perfect. It's so helpful that you offer this service.

The user, David Garcia, has requested a projector and a whiteboard. I will use the `request_meeting_equipment` tool to arrange for the delivery and also respond to his positive feedback.

We aim to make business travel as seamless as possible. I've arranged for a projector and a whiteboard to be delivered to your suite this evening, Mr. Garcia, so you'll have them in plenty of time for your meeting tomorrow. Please let us know if there is anything else we can do to help you prepare.
