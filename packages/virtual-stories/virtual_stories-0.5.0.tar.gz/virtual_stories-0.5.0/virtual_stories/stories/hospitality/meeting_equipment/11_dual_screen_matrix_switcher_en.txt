We’re running a dual-screen keynote with mirrored content and a separate audio feed. Do you have a 2×2 HDMI matrix and a DI box?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm inventory and availability windows.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—our 2×2 HDMI matrices (4K@60) and DI boxes are available. We can stage during 06:00–09:00 or 13:00–15:00, with on-call support until 21:00. We’ll include a spare HDMI as per policy.

user:
Great. Can you also route one laptop to both screens and a second laptop to just the right screen?

assistant channel=analysis:
Matrix supports that.

assistant channel=final:
That mapping is supported on the 2×2 matrix. We’ll label inputs and outputs for you and test audio via DI.

user:
Fun question—what’s your favorite conference snack?

assistant channel=analysis:
Chitchat.

assistant channel=final:
I’m partial to the fruit skewers—easy to grab between sessions.

user:
Before we lock it, can you provide the switcher’s full firmware image and change log for our IT audit?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond inventory scope; escalate and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for the thoroughness. Looking into the firmware image and change log availability.
