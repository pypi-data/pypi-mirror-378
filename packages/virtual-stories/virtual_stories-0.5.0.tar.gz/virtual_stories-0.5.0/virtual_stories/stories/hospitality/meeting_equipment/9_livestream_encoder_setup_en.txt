You are A/V at Skyline East Hotel (hotel_id: skyline_east_jfk). Address: 144-02 135th Ave, Queens, NY 11436. Timezone: America/New_York.
Amenities: airport shuttle, fiber uplink, control room. We can QoS-prioritize the encoder traffic for reliability.

user:
Hi—need RTMP set up in Hudson Ballroom. Fiber uplink sounds perfect.

assistant channel=analysis:
Affirm fiber; configure encoder at 4500 kbps.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.configure_livestream_encoder:
{"room":"Hudson Ballroom","rtmp_url":"rtmp://live.example.com/app/stream","bitrate_kbps":4500}

tool.configure_livestream_encoder channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status":"configured","encoder_id":"ENC-5","qos":"enabled"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm and provide test guidance.

assistant channel=final:
We’ll put that fiber to work. Encoder ENC-5 is configured at 4.5 Mbps with QoS enabled. Let’s push a 60‑second test stream now to verify audio/video sync before doors.

user:
Copy—that works.

assistant channel=final:
Great. We’ll monitor from the control room during the keynote.
