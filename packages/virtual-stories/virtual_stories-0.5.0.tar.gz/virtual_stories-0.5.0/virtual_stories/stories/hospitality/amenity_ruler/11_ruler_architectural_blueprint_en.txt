I need a 30cm metal ruler for blueprint measurements in room 1847. Can you send one up?

user:
The art deco lobby is stunning - reminds me of the Chrysler Building.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is complimenting the lobby design. I should acknowledge this positively using the property information about the art deco lobby with marble floors and gold accents.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! Our art deco lobby with marble floors and gold accents is inspired by that era's architectural elegance. It's one of our signature features.

user:
Do you have any drafting tables available for rent in the business center?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about drafting tables for rent. While I know the business center has drafting tables (mentioned in property highlights), I don't have specific information about rental availability, pricing, or booking procedures. This goes beyond my system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'm checking the rental options for drafting tables. Reviewing available resources.
