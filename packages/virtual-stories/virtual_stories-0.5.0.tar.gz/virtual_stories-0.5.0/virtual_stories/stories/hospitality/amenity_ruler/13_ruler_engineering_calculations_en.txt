user:
I need a ruler for some engineering calculations and technical drawings. What's your most precise option?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is an engineer needing precision tools. I should recommend the metal rulers which have 0.5mm graduations and mention the technical features that might interest them.

assistant channel=final:
For engineering work, I'd recommend our 30cm metal ruler with 0.5mm precision graduations and built-in angle guides. It's perfect for technical drawings and calculations. We also have 15cm metal rulers with center point indicators if you need something more compact.

user:
The 30cm metal ruler sounds ideal. I'm in room 2103. I noticed the exposed steel frame in the lobby - impressive engineering from the 1920s.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest appreciates the engineering aspects of the building. I should acknowledge their observation about the steel frame and confirm the ruler delivery.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent observation! That original 1920s steel frame construction is quite remarkable. I'll have the 30cm metal ruler delivered to room 2103 within 15 minutes. It includes the precision graduations and angle guides perfect for your engineering work.

user:
Do you have any engineering drawing templates or technical drafting supplies?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about engineering templates and drafting supplies beyond rulers. This information is not provided in the system prompt, so I need to use the ATTENTION flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'm investigating available drafting supplies. Reviewing available resources.

user:
The individual room climate control is quite sophisticated - much better than typical hotel systems.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is complimenting the HVAC system, which is mentioned in the system prompt. I should acknowledge this technical appreciation.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! Our modern HVAC system with individual room climate control is designed for both comfort and energy efficiency. It's particularly appreciated by guests who need consistent working conditions.
