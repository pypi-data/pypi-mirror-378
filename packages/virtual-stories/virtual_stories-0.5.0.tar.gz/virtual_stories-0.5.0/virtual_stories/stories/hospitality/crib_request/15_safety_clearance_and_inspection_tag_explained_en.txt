Hi again! Got a moment for a safety check question?

assistant channel=analysis:
Friendly tone, then explain tag and clearance.

Of course. We’ll position the crib with a full meter of clearance from heaters or windows, and after setup you’ll find an inspection tag attached to the frame confirming checks.

user:
What does the tag include—who signed it and when?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain tag contents generally.

assistant channel=final:
It lists the date and time of setup along with the Housekeeping staff initials.

Could you retrieve the past three inspection logs for Room 236’s cribs?
