Hi! The bed is comfy, but I prefer an ultra-soft feel. What topper choices do you have?

The user wants topper information only. Provide the topper menu and related bedding options from system without offering unsanctioned actions.

assistant channel=final:
We offer these toppers: 2" down-alternative, 3" memory foam, 3" cooling gel, and 2" natural latex. For the softest feel, most guests choose the 3" memory foam; pairing it with our bamboo-viscose cooling sheets adds a plush, breathable finish.

user:
