user:
Hi! I’ve got a 6 AM start. Any chance to tidy my terrier late tonight without disturbing neighbors?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide guidance respecting quiet hours; suggest earlier drying or towel-only grooming.

assistant channel=final:
Good luck on the race! For quiet hours, a towel-only tidy in the bathroom works best tonight, then a quick low-heat dry after 07:00 if you still need it. If a rinse is helpful, the Service Patio station runs 08:00–19:00.

user:
Could you line up a mobile groomer for 5 AM?

assistant channel=analysis:
External vendor coordination is beyond context. Use special flag.

[ATTENTION] Understood. Checking early-morning options.
