Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Concierge can loan a small grooming kit (brush, fabric ribbon, blunt-tip scissors) with ID hold, 2-hour limit. Use a spare sheet under grooming; maintain leash in Lobby; avoid seating fabrics.

user:
Hello! Could I borrow a ribbon and scissors to make my corgi look sharp?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm grooming kit availability and ID hold; share etiquette.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—we can loan a small grooming kit that includes a fabric ribbon and blunt-tip scissors with a quick ID hold for 2 hours. If you’re styling in your room, laying a spare sheet down keeps things tidy; on the way through the Lobby, leash on and no fabric seating is perfect.

user:
Any recommendation on the best bow style for corgis that wins points?

assistant channel=analysis:
Subjective show-judging advice is beyond context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Reviewing relevant styling guidance.
