Hi! We’ve got sunset photos—can I give my poodle a quick rinse and blow dry?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer rinse station hours and loaner dryer with ID hold and quiet hour constraints. Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
That sounds adorable—golden hour is perfect for photos. You can use our small rinse station at the Service Patio (L-1) until 19:00. We also have a compact low-heat dryer you can borrow from the Concierge with a quick ID hold for up to 2 hours. If you’re on Floors 6–8, keeping the dryer before 22:00 helps with quiet hours.

user:
Do you have nail trimming on site?
