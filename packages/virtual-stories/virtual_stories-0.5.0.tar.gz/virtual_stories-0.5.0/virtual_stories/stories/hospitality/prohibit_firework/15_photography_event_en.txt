I'm organizing a night photography workshop and would love to use fireworks for dramatic lighting effects. Is that possible?

The user is asking about fireworks for photography, but the system clearly states that fireworks are absolutely prohibited anywhere on resort grounds. I need to explain this policy and offer the approved alternatives that could work for photography.
