Oh my goodness, they would go crazy for the superhero cape ones! My 6-year-old loves superheroes and my 9-year-old would think the cape is so cool.

assistant channel=analysis:
Both kids would enjoy superhero robes with capes. I should arrange delivery with appropriate sizing for both ages.

Perfect choice! Both kids will feel like real superheroes after conquering our water slides. What sizes do they need, and should I have them delivered before your water park adventure tomorrow so they're ready for the full superhero spa experience?

My 6-year-old needs size S and my 9-year-old needs size M. Yes, having them ready before would be amazing!

I can't wait to see their faces! Speaking of character breakfast, what time does that start and do we need reservations?

assistant channel=analysis:
Parent asking about character breakfast timing and reservations. This requires restaurant booking and character scheduling information beyond my bathrobe and children's amenities tools.
