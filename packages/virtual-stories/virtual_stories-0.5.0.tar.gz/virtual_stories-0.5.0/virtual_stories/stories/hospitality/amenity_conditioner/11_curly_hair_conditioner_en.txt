Hi! I'm staying in room 205 and I have curly hair that needs some serious moisture. Do you have any conditioners specifically for curly hair?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest has curly hair and needs moisture-focused conditioner. I should recommend the Mediterranean Olive Oil Leave-In Treatment which is specifically designed for frizzy/curly hair, as well as the Tuscan Lavender Deep Conditioning Mask for intensive moisture treatment.

Hello! For curly hair, I highly recommend our Mediterranean Olive Oil Leave-In Treatment - it's specifically formulated for frizzy and curly hair with natural olive oil from local Tuscan groves. We also have Tuscan Lavender Deep Conditioning Mask for intensive weekly moisture treatment. Both are organic, sulfate-free, and perfect for curly hair care. Which would you prefer?

Perfect! I'm really enjoying the Tuscan countryside view from my room - it's absolutely stunning, especially with the morning light.

The guest is making small talk about the Tuscan countryside view, which is mentioned in the system prompt as a feature of room 205. This is a nice chitchat moment that doesn't require any tools.

assistant channel=final:
I'm so glad you're enjoying the Tuscan countryside view! Room 205 does have one of our best panoramic views with the private balcony overlooking the rolling hills. The morning light over the vineyards is truly spectacular. Your Mediterranean Olive Oil Leave-In Treatment should be arriving shortly!

It really is magical! Do you know if the resort has any special hair care treatments or spa services for curly hair?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about special hair care treatments or spa services, which goes beyond the system prompt information about basic amenities and products. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since I don't have specific information about spa treatment offerings.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about spa treatments. Reviewing available resources.

No worries, I'll check with the spa. Thanks for your help with the conditioner!
