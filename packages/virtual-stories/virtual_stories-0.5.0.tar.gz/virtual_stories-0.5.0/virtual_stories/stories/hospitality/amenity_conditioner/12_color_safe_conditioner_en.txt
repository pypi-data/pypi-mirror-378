Good morning! I'm in room 205 and I have colored hair that I need to protect. Do you have any color-safe conditioners that won't strip my color?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest has colored hair and needs color-safe conditioner. I should recommend the Argan & Keratin Repair Conditioner which is specifically designed for colored/chemically treated hair, as it will help protect and maintain hair color.

Good morning! For colored hair, I highly recommend our Argan & Keratin Repair Conditioner - it's specifically formulated for colored and chemically treated hair with argan oil and keratin to protect and maintain your color. It's sulfate-free and paraben-free, which is essential for color protection. Would you like me to arrange delivery to room 205?

user:
The Argan & Keratin Repair Conditioner sounds perfect! I love that it's sulfate-free and has keratin for protection. Can you deliver it to my room?

The guest wants to order the Argan & Keratin Repair Conditioner for room delivery. I need to provide information about delivery options and timing.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice! The Argan & Keratin Repair Conditioner is perfect for colored hair with its protective argan oil and keratin formula. I'll arrange delivery to room 205 - it should arrive within 10 minutes. The standard 200ml size is ideal for your stay. Use it after shampooing to help maintain your color vibrancy.

user:
Perfect! I'm really enjoying the Tuscan countryside view from my room - it's absolutely breathtaking, especially with the morning light.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is making small talk about the Tuscan countryside view, which is mentioned in the system prompt as a feature of room 205. This is a nice chitchat moment that doesn't require any tools.

assistant channel=final:
I'm so glad you're enjoying the Tuscan countryside view! Room 205 does have one of our best panoramic views with the private balcony overlooking the rolling hills. The morning light over the vineyards is truly spectacular. Your Argan & Keratin Repair Conditioner should be arriving shortly!

user:
It really is magical! Do you know if the resort has any special color maintenance treatments or salon services?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about special color maintenance treatments or salon services, which goes beyond the system prompt information about basic amenities and products. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since I don't have specific information about salon or treatment offerings.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about salon services. Reviewing available resources.

user:
No worries, I'll check with the spa. Thanks for your help with the conditioner!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is thanking me and ending the conversation. I should provide a friendly closing response.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! Enjoy your Argan & Keratin Repair Conditioner with the beautiful Tuscan countryside view. Have a wonderful day!
