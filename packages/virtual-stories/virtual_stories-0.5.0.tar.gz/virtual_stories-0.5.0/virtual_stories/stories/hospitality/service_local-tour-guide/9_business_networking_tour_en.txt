Includes visits to startup accelerators, angel investor networks, and executive introductions. $125/hour ($500 total). Meet in our executive business lounge.

user:
I'd love to visit some of those famous Seattle coffee shops too.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is asking about coffee shops as part of the business tour, which could be networking venues but would be more casual than the executive-level focus requested.

assistant channel=final:
Great idea! Seattle's coffee culture is integral to business networking here. Sarah will include stops at executive-frequented cafes where many deals are made - like the original Starbucks Reserve Roastery where many tech leaders meet for informal discussions.

user:
Can you help arrange follow-up meetings with promising contacts after the tour?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is asking about meeting scheduling services, which was mentioned as available in the professional services but would go beyond the standard tour guide service.

[ATTENTION] Follow-up meeting coordination details aren't specified in our current tour services. Reviewing available assistance options.
