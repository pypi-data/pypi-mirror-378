My wife and I love trying authentic local food. Can we get a 4-hour culinary walking tour starting at 11 AM tomorrow? She's vegetarian but I eat everything.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is a food tour request for 2 people with one vegetarian dietary restriction. They want 4 hours starting at 11 AM. I should book both the culinary tour and the regular guide service.

What's the signature dish we absolutely must try here?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is asking about signature local dishes, which would be part of the culinary knowledge about Low Country cuisine that's mentioned in our system information.

assistant channel=final:
You must try authentic Low Country shrimp and grits - it originated right here in the coastal Georgia region! For your wife, Chef Maria will show you incredible vegetarian versions using local stone-ground grits with seasonal vegetables and that same rich, complex flavor profile.

user:
Can we visit that famous praline shop I saw on Instagram?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is asking about a specific praline shop that was seen on social media, which goes beyond the general information about pralines being famous in the area and our restaurant partnerships.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Specific praline shop details aren't in our current tour information. Gathering more details about local options.
