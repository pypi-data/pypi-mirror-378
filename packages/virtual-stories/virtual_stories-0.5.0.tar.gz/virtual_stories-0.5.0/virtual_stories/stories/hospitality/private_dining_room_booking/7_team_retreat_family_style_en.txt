Hello! Could we have a cozy family-style dinner for 12 next Wednesday at 6?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check availability 18:00 for 150 minutes; suggest board games and note no outside food; add friendly small talk about mural.

assistant channel=final:
The Aspen Den is available 6–8:30 PM (HOLD-ASPEN-0827-1800). Our family-style dinner works great for teams, and we can set out Catan, Scrabble, and Chess after dessert. The mountain mural makes the room feel like a cabin—shall I hold for 12 and note any dietary needs?

user:
Two vegetarians and one nut allergy. Catan sounds fun!

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge restrictions and confirm Catan.

assistant channel=final:
Got it—two vegetarians, one nut allergy, and we’ll set Catan aside. We’ll seat 12 family-style and keep dessert nut-free. Would you like coffee service during games?
