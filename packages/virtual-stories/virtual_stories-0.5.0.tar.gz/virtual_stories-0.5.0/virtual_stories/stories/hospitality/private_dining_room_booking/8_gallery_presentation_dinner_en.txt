Hi—can we present a short 20-minute deck then have dinner for 15 next Tuesday at 7?

We can hold the Meridian Room 7–9:30 PM (HOLD-MERIDIAN-0826-1900). AV is set: 4K HDMI, blackout shades, USB‑C adapter, and a wired clicker. The marina lights look beautiful after dusk—shall I note 15 guests and arrange water on arrival before your short deck?

user:
Yes, and please do a light seafood menu.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge menu preference and finalize hold details.

assistant channel=final:
Done—15 guests with a light seafood menu, water on arrival, and your 20‑minute deck first. We’ll have blackout shades down before you begin, then lift them for dinner.
