Congratulations to your graduate! The Liffey Chamber is available 6:30–9:00 PM (HOLD-LIFFEY-0829-1830). We’ll set the 85" display for your slideshow and can pair dinner with wildberry fizz, lemon‑basil spritz, and elderflower mint coolers. Shall I note any dietary needs?

user:
One vegetarian and no alcohol for everyone.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge and confirm mocktail-only service.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect—we’ll keep it alcohol‑free with mocktail pairings and ensure a hearty vegetarian option. We’ll place tissues by the display—graduation slides can be emotional!
