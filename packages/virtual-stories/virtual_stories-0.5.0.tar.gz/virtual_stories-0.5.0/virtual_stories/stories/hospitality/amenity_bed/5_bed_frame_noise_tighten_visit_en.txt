Hi, every time I turn over, the bed in 1411 creaks loudly.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for letting me know. I’ve scheduled engineering—ETA ~26 minutes to tighten the frame and add felt pads. If you prefer morning, I can switch the visit and have a temporary shim placed tonight.

user:
I’ll take the evening fix. By the way, the lobby smells like fresh citrus.

assistant channel=analysis:
Chit-chat acknowledgment.

assistant channel=final:
Glad the scent feels pleasant this evening.

user:
Can you also upgrade my room because of this?

assistant channel=analysis:

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’ll review room upgrade options with the front desk.
