Hi team! Friendly note: first‑time drivers hesitate at the split between self‑parking and valet. Maybe an overhead sign at the ramp mouth?

assistant channel=analysis:
Thank, state current signage and lanes; offer to log suggestion.

assistant channel=final:
Appreciate the heads‑up. Blue arrows mark valet and green mark self‑parking; P2 is valet‑only, P1 is guest parking. I’ll submit your overhead‑sign idea for Facilities review.

user:
Where’s the closest pedestrian exit from P1 to the lobby?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from facts: P1 north stair or east elevator to lobby.

assistant channel=final:
From P1, you can take the north stair to the lobby, or the east elevator directly up.

Could you provide the garage’s monthly incident heatmap and corner mirror maintenance logs?

Beyond facts—use special flag.
