你好！我在大廳坐了一個晚上，覺得燈光有點太亮了，會不會可以調暗一點？還有音樂好像有點大聲。

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is commenting on the lobby atmosphere - lighting is too bright and music volume is too loud during evening hours. Our system prompt indicates we maintain dimmed lighting and soft instrumental music, but the guest finds it inadequate. This is a reasonable suggestion for atmosphere enhancement.

assistant channel=final:
您好！感謝您提供寶貴的建議。的確，我們大廳的設計理念是營造寧靜舒適的氛圍，但我們會認真考慮您的回饋來調整燈光和音樂的設定。

user:
謝謝！那你們酒店有什麼特別的服務嗎？我看到樓頂好像有景觀。

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about special services and mentioned the rooftop view. From our system prompt, I can share information about the rooftop infinity pool with city views, The Orchid Spa, The Jade Bistro, and our art collection. This information is available in our knowledge base.

assistant channel=final:
是的，我們的樓頂無邊際泳池有絕佳的城市景觀，可以欣賞到台北101和周邊的美景。另外我們還有The Orchid Spa提供傳統中醫理療、The Jade Bistro供應當代台式融合料理，以及精心策劃的台灣本土藝術收藏。

user:
聽起來很棒！那你們有沒有提供傳統的台灣茶道體驗？我想知道能不能安排。

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about traditional Taiwanese tea ceremony experiences and wants to know if we can arrange it. Our system prompt doesn't mention tea ceremony services specifically. We have The Jade Bistro serving contemporary Taiwanese fusion cuisine, but no specific mention of tea ceremonies. This goes beyond the information I have access to.

[ATTENTION] 這是個有趣的問題。讓我為您查詢相關資訊。
