Hi! The sunset was gorgeous. Small thought: folks seem unsure where to drop towels—maybe a decal near the return bins?

assistant channel=analysis:
Thank guest, reference existing bins and reminder flow.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—sunsets are our specialty. We have two return bins by the lifeguard chair and the sauna door, and we text a gentle reminder at 18:30 if a towel stays checked out. I’ll note the decal idea for our signage update.

user:
What time does the pool actually close for swimming, and do you still have a shower chair?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from facts: pool 07:00–21:30; shower chair available.

assistant channel=final:
Swimming wraps at 21:30, and yes—we can provide a shower chair on request. Just swing by the desk and we’ll set it up.

user:
Could you share the last 6 months of towel loss rates broken down by hour and weather?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond provided facts—use the flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about towel loss analytics. Searching for more information.
