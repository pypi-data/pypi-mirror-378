Hi, I'm a digital artist in the penthouse suite 2801. I'm creating a temporary multi-screen installation and need 4 HDMI cables for my project. Can you help?

assistant channel=analysis:
This guest needs 4 HDMI cables for an art installation. I should check if we have 4 units available and can accommodate this larger quantity request for the penthouse suite.

assistant channel=analysis:
Great! All 4 cables are available and held. Now I'll create a comped rental order for the artist's project and schedule delivery to the penthouse.

Absolutely! Four HDMI cables are reserved for your installation (order RNT-2801-44789). Maria will deliver them to penthouse suite 2801 in about 18 minutes - all comped under our artist support program. The cables work with your TV's multiple HDMI inputs for your multi-screen setup.
