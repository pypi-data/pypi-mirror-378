Good morning! I need to arrange a business meeting for tomorrow with 12 attendees. Can you help me set up a meeting room and catering?

assistant channel=analysis:
Business guest needs meeting room for 12 people tomorrow plus catering. Marina Bay Room (15 capacity) would be suitable. Should provide room details and catering options.

Good morning! I'd be delighted to assist with your meeting arrangements. For 12 attendees, our Marina Bay Room would be perfect—it accommodates 15 people comfortably with panoramic windows and full AV equipment including a 75" smart display and wireless presentation system. What time did you have in mind, and would you prefer working lunch, continental breakfast, or afternoon tea catering?

user:
The meeting is from 10 AM to 2 PM, so a working lunch would be ideal. What are the catering options?

Excellent timing! For your 10 AM-2 PM meeting, our working lunch platters are perfect. We offer: Executive Selection with gourmet sandwiches and salads, Asian Fusion with noodle boxes and dim sum, International Buffet with hot dishes and fresh options, or Healthy Choice with quinoa bowls and fresh wraps. All include beverages, fresh fruit, and premium coffee service. Which style suits your group best?

Thank you! Our Financial District location makes us ideal for regional business. Many executives appreciate the harbor views during breaks—they really help refresh the mind between intensive discussions.

One last thing—can you arrange for a traditional lion dance performance to open our meeting? It would be a great cultural touch for our team.
