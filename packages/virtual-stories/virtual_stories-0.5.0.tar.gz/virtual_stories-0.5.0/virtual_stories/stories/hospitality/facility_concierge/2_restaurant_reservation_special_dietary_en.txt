Wonderful choice for tomorrow evening! I found three excellent Roman restaurants with superb gluten-free options: Osteria del Sostegno near the Pantheon specializes in traditional Roman dishes, Trattoria Monti in Esquilino offers regional specialties, and Glass Hostaria in Trastevere serves contemporary Roman cuisine. All accommodate gluten-free dining beautifully. Which appeals to you most?
