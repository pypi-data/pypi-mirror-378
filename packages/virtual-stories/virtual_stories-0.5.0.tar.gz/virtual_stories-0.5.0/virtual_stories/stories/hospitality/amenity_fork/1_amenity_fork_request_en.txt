user:
Hi, I just ordered some food to my room, but I don't have a fork. Can you send one up? My room number is 123.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is requesting a fork for their room. I should use the `request_amenity` tool to fulfill this request. I will need to confirm the amenity name, room number, and quantity. The user has provided all of this information.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "fork", "room_number": "123", "quantity": 1}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A fork has been dispatched to room 123."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I should now inform the user that a fork is on its way. I can also add a small chitchat to be more friendly.

assistant channel=final:
Of course! A fork is on its way to your room right now. I hope you are enjoying your meal!

user:
Thank you! By the way, do you know if the hotel has a swimming pool?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about a swimming pool. This information is not available in my system prompt or tools. I will have to use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'm looking into this.
