I’m tall—do you have a chair that goes high enough for a 72 cm desk and good armrest range?

assistant channel=analysis:
SAR-Ergo Tall fits tall guests; seat up to 58 cm, arm up to 28 cm above seat. Works for 72 cm desk.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the SAR-Ergo Tall raises to 58 cm with armrests adjustable 18–28 cm above the seat, which pairs well with our ~72 cm desks. I can deliver and set it up in about 15–25 minutes.

user:
Great. Could you also set the lumbar for me?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer setup, include lumbar placement guidance.

assistant channel=final:
Of course—we’ll dial the lumbar to sit around belt-line height and fine-tune once you’re seated.

user:
Also—any live music spots walking distance tonight?

Out of scope; respond with ATTENTION.
