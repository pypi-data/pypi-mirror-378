Can you provide a chair that won’t roll on the hard floor? Do you have glides instead of wheels?

assistant channel=analysis:
System allows glide swaps; no fee for first swap; fast turnaround.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we can swap the casters for soft-floor glides on any chair within about 10 minutes, and there’s no fee for your first swap tonight. Would you like Mesh Comfort or Classic Task as the base?

user:
Mesh Comfort, please—and could you help set the height?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer setup aligned to 73 cm desk.

assistant channel=final:
Certainly. We’ll fit glides to the Mesh Comfort and set the seat for a ~73 cm desk so your forearms rest parallel to the work surface.

user:
Side note—what’s the best local coffee roaster around here?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; ATTENTION.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That’s beyond the provided info. Accessing available options.

user:
Thanks—looking forward to the non-rolling setup.

assistant channel=analysis:
Close with brief reassurance.

assistant channel=final:
You’re set—we’ll deliver the glide-fitted chair and adjust it on arrival.
