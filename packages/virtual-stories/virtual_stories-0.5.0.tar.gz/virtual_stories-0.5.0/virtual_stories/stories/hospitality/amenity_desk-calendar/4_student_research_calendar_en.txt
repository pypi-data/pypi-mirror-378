Hello! I'm a graduate student in room 1805 working on my thesis. I need a desk calendar to help organize my research schedule and track deadlines. Do you have anything specifically designed for academic use?

assistant channel=analysis:
The graduate student in room 1805 needs an academic desk calendar for thesis work. This matches our study amenities perfectly. I can use the order_study_amenity tool with academic features specified.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.order_study_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "Academic Desk Calendar", "room_number": "1805", "academic_features": ["Deadline Tracking", "Research Planning Templates", "Thesis Milestones"]}

tool.order_study_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "confirmed", "delivery_time": "12 minutes", "message": "Academic desk calendar with deadline tracking and research templates is being prepared for room 1805."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The study amenity order was successful. I should mention our academic resources and study lounge since this guest is working on a thesis, as these are available in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice for your thesis work! I've ordered our academic desk calendar with deadline tracking templates and research planning sections for your room. It will be delivered in about 12 minutes. You might also be interested in our 24/7 study lounge and research library access.

user:
That sounds perfect for organizing my research timeline. Speaking of the study lounge, what's the atmosphere like there? I'm wondering if it's quiet enough for focused work.

assistant channel=analysis:
The student is asking about the study lounge atmosphere. This is chitchat/small talk about our facilities that's answerable from the system prompt - I can describe the academic environment without needing tools.

assistant channel=final:
Our study lounge maintains a quiet, focused atmosphere perfect for academic work. We have designated quiet zones, individual study pods, and group collaboration areas. The space is soundproofed and monitored to ensure a productive environment, with ambient background music available in some areas and complete silence in others.

user:
Great, that sounds ideal. One more thing - I'm attending a conference next month and need to arrange travel. Can you recommend transportation options from the hotel to the convention center?

assistant channel=analysis:
The student is asking about transportation to a convention center for a conference. The system prompt mentions airport shuttle service but doesn't provide details about convention center transportation or local transit options. This goes beyond the available information, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you need transportation to the convention center. Let me look into the available options for you.
