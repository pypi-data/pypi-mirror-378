Hi there! We're in Family Suite 1205 with our two kids. We're planning our vacation activities and could really use a desk calendar. Do you have anything fun and kid-friendly?

assistant channel=analysis:
Family in Suite 1205 is requesting a desk calendar for vacation planning. They specifically want something kid-friendly, which matches our family amenities. I can use the order_family_amenity tool with kid-friendly preferences.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.order_family_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "Kid-Friendly Desk Calendar", "room_number": "1205", "family_preferences": ["Fun Themes", "Activity Spaces", "Colorful Design"]}

tool.order_family_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "confirmed", "delivery_time": "15 minutes", "message": "Kid-friendly desk calendar with fun themes and activity spaces is being prepared for Family Suite 1205."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The family amenity order was confirmed. I should mention our kids' club and family activities since they're traveling with children, as this information is available in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful! I've ordered our special kid-friendly desk calendar with fun themes and activity spaces for your suite. It will arrive in about 15 minutes. Your children might also enjoy our complimentary Kids' Club with supervised activities from 9 AM to 5 PM.

user:
That sounds great! The kids will love that. By the way, what's the best time to visit the adventure playground? We want to make sure we don't miss the fun activities.

assistant channel=analysis:
The parent is asking about the adventure playground timing. This is a chitchat question about resort activities that's answerable from the system prompt - I can provide information about the playground and other family features without needing tools.

assistant channel=final:
The adventure playground is open daily from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, with the most popular activity times being mid-morning (10:00 AM - 12:00 PM) and late afternoon (3:00 PM - 5:00 PM) when our activity coordinators are most engaged with the children. We also have story time at 11:00 AM and craft sessions at 4:00 PM.

user:
Perfect! We'll plan around those times. One question - are there any special holiday events happening this week that we should know about?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about special holiday events. The system prompt provides information about resort features and activities but doesn't specify any particular holiday events or schedule details beyond the general amenities. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'd be happy to help you learn about any special events this week. Let me check our current event schedule for you.
