Hello, I'm in suite 2501. I have a lot of meetings to keep track of this week and I was wondering if you have a desk calendar I could use?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest in suite 2501 is requesting a desk calendar. This is an available amenity, so I can use the `order_room_amenity` tool to fulfill this request.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.order_room_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "Desk Calendar", "room_number": "2501"}

tool.order_room_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A desk calendar is being sent to suite 2501. It will be delivered within 15 minutes."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I will inform the guest that the desk calendar is on its way.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely. I have ordered a desk calendar to be delivered to your suite. It should arrive within 15 minutes.

user:
Perfect, thank you. This hotel is very well-equipped for business travelers.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is making a positive comment about the hotel's amenities for business travelers. I should acknowledge this and reinforce the hotel's brand.

assistant channel=final:
You're welcome. We're glad you think so. We strive to provide everything our business guests might need for a productive and comfortable stay.

user:
I need to have some documents notarized. Is that a service you provide at the business center?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about notary services. The system prompt mentions a business center, but does not specify if notary services are available. I do not have a tool to check for this information. I will use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you have a request for notary services. I'm looking into this for you.
