user:
Which letterhead and envelopes match well for a formal thank-you?

assistant channel=analysis:
Recommend Classic Cream + DL Classic, or Modern White + C5 Modern.

assistant channel=final:
For a formal thank‑you, Classic Cream with DL Classic is elegant; Modern White with C5 Modern is a crisp alternative. Both include peel‑and‑seal envelopes.

user:
I’ll go with Classic Cream. Can you insert it into the envelope for me?

assistant channel=analysis:
Preparation allows alignment and insertion.

assistant channel=final:
Certainly—we’ll prepare the sheet and insert it into a DL Classic envelope so it’s ready to send.

user:
By the way—any recommendations for an art exhibit tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; provide ATTENTION.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That information isn’t included here. Reviewing available resources.

user:
Thanks! This is perfect.

assistant channel=analysis:
Close courteously.

assistant channel=final:
Glad to hear it—we’ll have your matching set ready shortly.
