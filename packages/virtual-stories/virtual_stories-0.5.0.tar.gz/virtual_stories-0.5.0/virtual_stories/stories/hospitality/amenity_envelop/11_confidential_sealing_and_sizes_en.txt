Do you have security-tinted envelopes and can you seal them confidentially?

assistant channel=analysis:
Security tint DL/C5; peel & seal and “Confidential” stamp; tamper tape available.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we carry security‑tinted DL and C5 envelopes with peel‑and‑seal closures. On request we can apply a “Confidential” stamp and tamper‑evident tape.

user:
Perfect. I also need one C4 to fit an A4 without folding—do you have that?

assistant channel=analysis:
C4 fits full A4; price $0.40 after complimentary quota.

assistant channel=final:
We do—C4 fits a full A4 unfolded. It’s complimentary if within your first three; otherwise $0.40 each.

Side note—any seafood spot you’d recommend?
