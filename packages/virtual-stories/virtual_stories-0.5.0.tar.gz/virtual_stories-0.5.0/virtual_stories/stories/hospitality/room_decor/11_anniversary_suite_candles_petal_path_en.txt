Hi there! I’m trying to plan a surprise for my spouse in a Pearl Suite. Could you help me set up a petal path and some candles?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm suite type, propose packages, check setup time and inventory; include small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—we’ll make it special! The Pearl Suite has great console and bedside outlets for ambient lighting. For the surprise, may I suggest our Petal Path Basic ($45) plus the Candle Glow Set (24 flameless candles for $35)? We can add an extra 24 candles for $25 if you’d like a fuller look. How does that sound? And how’s your day going so far?

user:
Day’s going great, thanks! Let’s do the petal path and 48 candles. Can you do a light vanilla scent too?

assistant channel=analysis:
Check scent policy and inventory; confirm timing and scent option.

assistant channel=final:
Lovely choice. We’ll use the hypoallergenic vanilla bean diffuser—fully within our scent policy. Inventory looks good: petals and 48 candles are available today. Earliest guaranteed setup is 15:00 during our housekeeping window (14:30–16:00). Could you step out or visit the café around that time to keep the surprise?

user:
Yes, we’ll be out. Also, are real candles okay if we keep them supervised?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from policy: real flames prohibited.

assistant channel=final:
For safety and per city ordinance, only flameless LED candles are permitted in rooms. The warm-white LEDs look great dimmed in the Pearl Suite, and we can cluster a few by the console to create depth.

user:
Great. Could you also arrange a custom neon sign with our names by this evening?

assistant channel=analysis:
This requires external vendor and rush production—beyond stated system scope.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for the custom neon idea. Reviewing available resources.
