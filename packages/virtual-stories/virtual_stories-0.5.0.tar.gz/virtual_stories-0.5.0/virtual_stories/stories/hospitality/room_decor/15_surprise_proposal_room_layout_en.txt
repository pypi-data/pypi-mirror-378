user:
Hi! Can you help design a walking path that ends at the window with a photo spot?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use petals standard and candle clusters; confirm safety path; add small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—let’s guide from foyer to the window using Petals Standard ($45) and two LED clusters ($36). We’ll keep a 90 cm clear path and avoid the HVAC intake near the window’s right side. We can angle the console for a sweet photo nook. Sounds like a beautiful moment—feeling excited?

user:
Very! Could we place the “Love” banner above the headboard?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm available and feasible.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—the blush/ivory banner can be centered above the headboard ($18 rental) with non-marking hooks.

user:
Can you coordinate a same-day photographer to hide in the room before we arrive?

assistant channel=analysis:
External vendor coordination beyond scope; invoke flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Noted on the discreet photography request. Assessing the available data.
