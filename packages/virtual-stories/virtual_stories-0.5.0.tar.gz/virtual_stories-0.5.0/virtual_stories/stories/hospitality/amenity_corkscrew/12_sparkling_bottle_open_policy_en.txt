Hi! Can you send up a Champagne stopper and help me open a bottle in 1422 at 8 PM?

Confirm desk hours (until 22:00); 20:00 is valid; give ETA and items.

Yes—we can assist at 8:00 PM. Our Wine Tools Desk operates 10:00–22:00, and delivery to rooms takes about 10–15 minutes. We’ll bring a Champagne stopper and open the bottle with a towel‑wrap at 45°.
