Yes—our self-service launderette is on the B2 annex corridor (past the service elevators). It’s open 06:00–23:00 with the last wash at 22:00. Pricing is Washer £3 and Dryer £2 per cycle, payable by contactless cards or hotel tokens. Detergent and softener are available from the vending machine, and there are folding stations onsite. Have a smooth laundry run!

user:
Thanks, that sounds convenient.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge small talk without tools.

assistant channel=final:
Glad it helps—enjoy your stay.

user:
Can someone monitor my clothes the whole time?

assistant channel=analysis:
Continuous monitoring isn’t described and there’s no tool covering staffing beyond brief rounds—use the special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for checking coverage. Reviewing available resources.
