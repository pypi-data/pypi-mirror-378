HELP! I'm getting married tomorrow and I just spilled red wine all over the bodice of my wedding dress! It's a vintage lace Vera Wang - what can you do?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is a true bridal emergency - red wine on vintage lace Vera Wang dress with wedding tomorrow. I need to check emergency bridal care immediately for wine stain treatment.

user:
Oh thank goodness! Should I try to blot it or just bring it as-is?

assistant channel=analysis:
Bride is asking about immediate first-aid for the wine stain. This is beyond tool scope since it requires specific stain treatment protocol advice that isn't covered by the emergency service tool.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Please bring it exactly as-is without any treatment. Looking up the best preservation approach.

user:
Okay, I'm heading there now. How much will this cost?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about emergency service pricing. The system mentions insurance coverage up to £10,000 and we offer preservation guarantees, but specific emergency pricing isn't detailed in system context.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Let me check the emergency service rates for you. Gathering current pricing information.

user:
I'm so stressed about this whole thing.

assistant channel=analysis:
Bride is expressing stress about the situation. I should provide comfort and reassurance using the amenities mentioned in our system like champagne service and comfort amenities.

assistant channel=final:
I completely understand! Wedding dress emergencies are incredibly stressful. When you arrive at the bridal suite level, we'll have champagne waiting and our comfort amenities to help you relax while our specialist works their magic. You're in the best possible hands - this is exactly what we specialize in.
