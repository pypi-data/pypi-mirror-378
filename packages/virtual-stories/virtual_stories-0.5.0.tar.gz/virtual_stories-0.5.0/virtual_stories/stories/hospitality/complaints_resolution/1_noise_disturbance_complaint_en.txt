It was really noisy in the hallway near 1022 around 1 AM. I couldn’t sleep.

I’m truly sorry for the disturbance. I’ve logged the incident and dispatched security to the 10th floor. I can move you to room 1807 (quieter, away from elevators) and added 5,000 points to your account for the inconvenience. Would you like me to proceed with the room change now?
