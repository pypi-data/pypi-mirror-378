Hi, I need to staple together several sets of construction drawings for tomorrow's coordination meeting. These are 11x17 sheets - about 20 pages per set, and I need 8 complete sets.

Perfect! I've reserved the long-reach stapler which can handle 11x17 sheets perfectly. The 20-page sets are well within capacity, and they have additional plan handling tools available.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect for construction drawings! I've reserved our long-reach stapler station (11" reach) that handles 11x17 sheets beautifully. Location is Design Center B1 with 24/7 access. Additional tools like cutting mats and plan tubes are available too.

Excellent! Quick question - is there a good place to grab dinner nearby? This might take a while.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about nearby dinner options. This isn't covered in our architecture hotel services and amenities.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Good question about dining options. Let me look into the best spots in the design district.

user:
Also, do you have any large format paper if I need to make copies of specific details?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about large format paper, which relates to our blueprint printing and reproduction services that go up to 42" width.

assistant channel=final:
Yes! Our Blueprint Reproduction Center stocks paper up to 42" width in various weights. Standard architectural bond, vellum, and mylar are always available. The reproduction station is right next to the stapler area for convenience.
