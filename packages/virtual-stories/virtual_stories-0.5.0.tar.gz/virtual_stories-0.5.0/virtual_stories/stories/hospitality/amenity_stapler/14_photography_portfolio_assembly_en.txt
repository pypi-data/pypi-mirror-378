Hello! I'm a professional photographer preparing my portfolio for an important exhibit opening tomorrow. I need to assemble 50 copies of my 25-page portfolio booklets that need stapling. Do you have appropriate equipment?

Excellent! One more question - I'm looking for some local photography studios or galleries where I might display my work while I'm in town. Any recommendations?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for recommendations about local photography studios and galleries outside our hotel. This goes beyond our immediate hotel services and knowledge base - we don't have detailed information about external art venues, so this requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a great idea for showcasing your work locally. Exploring photography venue options.
