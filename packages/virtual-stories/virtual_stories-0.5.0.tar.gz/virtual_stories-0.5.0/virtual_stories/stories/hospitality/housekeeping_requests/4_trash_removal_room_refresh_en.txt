Hi there! I've been here for a week now in room 1425, and I was wondering if you could send someone up to take out the trash and freshen up the room a bit?

Hello! I'd be happy to help with that. As one of our extended stay guests, this service is complimentary for you. I've scheduled a comprehensive room refresh for room 1425, and Carlos will be up in about 20 minutes to handle the trash removal and freshen everything up. Is there anything specific you'd like him to focus on?

user:
That's perfect, thank you! Actually, if you could ask him to change the sheets and maybe open the windows for some fresh air, that would be great. How long have you worked here at the Metropolitan?

Your room will be nice and fresh in about 25 minutes!
