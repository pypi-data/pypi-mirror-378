Hi! I'm in room 512 with my dog Max, and I was wondering if you could send someone up for a pet-friendly cleaning?

Hello! We'd be happy to help with Max's room cleaning. I've scheduled our specialized pet-friendly service for room 512, which includes deep vacuuming for pet hair, stain treatment, odor elimination, and floor mopping with pet-safe products. Alex will also bring extra towels, waste bags, pet bed freshener, and a water bowl. Everything will be ready in about 18 minutes. Is there anything specific about Max's needs I should know?

user:
That's perfect! Max is a golden retriever, so he does shed quite a bit. Could you make sure they use the extra-strength hair removal tools? By the way, are there any pet-friendly hiking trails nearby?

Update cleaning service with breed-specific instructions and engage in conversation about pet-friendly amenities.

Great! I've updated the service to include our extra-strength hair removal toolsâ€”perfect for golden retrievers. As for hiking trails, we have several pet-friendly options right from the lodge! The Meadow Trail is excellent for dogs and offers beautiful mountain views, and the Lake Trail is perfect for a relaxing walk with Max. Both are well-maintained and popular with our pet guests. Your room will be thoroughly cleaned and fresh in about 22 minutes.

user:
That sounds wonderful! Max will love the Meadow Trail. Thanks so much for all the pet-friendly services here.

You're very welcome! We love having pets at Rocky Mountain Lodge, and Max is going to have a great time on the trails. Your room will be completely fresh and pet-ready when Alex is done.
