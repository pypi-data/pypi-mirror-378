Hi! The lemon-mint water is refreshing. Could I get two hypoallergenic blankets and confirm turn-down at 20:30?

Small talk acknowledged; blankets available; schedule turndown 20:30 within window; delivery time estimate.

Absolutely—two hypoallergenic microfiber blankets are on the way. Standard delivery is about 15–20 minutes. I’ve scheduled turn-down for 20:30 within our 18:30–22:30 window, and we’ll use fragrance-free items with no feathers.

user:
Can you switch my pillows to feather-free too?

assistant channel=analysis:
Feather-free pillows available.

assistant channel=final:
Done—I’ll have feather-free pillows swapped in during delivery so everything matches your allergen preferences.

user:
Also, could you provide a medical-grade HEPA air test tonight?

Beyond scope; use special flag.
