How energy efficient are the toasters? I'm concerned about environmental impact.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about energy efficiency and environmental impact, which are clearly detailed in the system prompt under Energy Efficiency Specifications and Environmental Sustainability Features. I can provide comprehensive environmental information.

assistant channel=final:
Our toasters are ENERGY STAR certified with excellent energy efficiency. The Dualit Mini Classic uses 800W and the Cuisinart Compact uses 1200W, both with automatic shutoff to prevent unnecessary power consumption. They have ultra-low standby power (under 1W) and use quartz heating elements for faster, more efficient toasting. Each toast cycle has an estimated carbon footprint of only 0.05 kg CO2. The appliances are made with 40% post-consumer recycled plastic and come in 100% recyclable packaging. We also have a certified e-waste recycling program for proper disposal.

user:
Can you modify the toasters to run on solar power or integrate them with smart home energy management systems?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about modifying toasters for solar power or smart home integration, which goes beyond what's available in the system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since no tools or system knowledge covers toaster modifications for solar power or smart home system integration.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand your request. Checking available options.
