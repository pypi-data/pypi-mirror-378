Yes, we do! We have toasters available for loan to all guests. Currently, we have both Dualit Mini Classic (2-slice) and Cuisinart Compact (4-slice) models available. The loan is free and includes a safety card with usage instructions. Would you like me to deliver one to room 789?

user:
That sounds great! What's the process for getting one?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about the process for getting a toaster, which is covered in our system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
It's very simple! I can arrange delivery to your room within 10-15 minutes. The loan duration is up to 24 hours per request, and we provide a safety card with proper usage instructions. When you're done, just call us and we'll arrange pickup. The toasters are designed for countertop use only with 6 inches of clearance.

Perfect! I'm really looking forward to having fresh toast for breakfast. The continental breakfast sounds good too.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is making small talk about looking forward to fresh toast and referencing our continental breakfast service.

assistant channel=final:
That's wonderful! Fresh toast is such a great way to start the day. Our continental breakfast is available from 6:00 AM to 11:00 AM and includes fresh fruit platters, yogurt parfaits, and special dietary accommodations. The toaster will give you even more breakfast options in your room.

user:
Do you know what time the toaster service is available? Can I request one late at night?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about toaster service hours, which is mentioned in our system knowledge as 24/7.

assistant channel=final:
Our toaster service is available 24/7! You can request one anytime, day or night. We understand that guests have different schedules, so we make sure the service is always available. The delivery time is typically 10-15 minutes regardless of the time.

user:
That's very convenient! I'm planning to do some work in my room tonight and might want a late-night snack.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is mentioning wanting a late-night snack and working in their room, which relates to our business center amenities.

assistant channel=final:
That sounds like a great plan! Our business center is available 24/7 if you need printing or scanning services for your work. And yes, the toaster is perfect for late-night snacks - there's nothing quite like warm toast when you're working late.

user:
Do you have any recommendations for local restaurants that deliver late at night?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about local restaurant delivery recommendations, which goes beyond our system knowledge of hotel amenities.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll look into local restaurant delivery options for you. Checking available resources.

user:
Actually, I think I'll just use the toaster and maybe order from room service. The continental breakfast menu sounds good for a late snack too.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is referencing our room service and continental breakfast, which are mentioned in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
That's a great idea! Our room service continental breakfast is available until 11:00 AM, and we have other menu options available 24/7. The toaster will give you even more flexibility for late-night snacks. Just give us a call when you're ready for delivery!
