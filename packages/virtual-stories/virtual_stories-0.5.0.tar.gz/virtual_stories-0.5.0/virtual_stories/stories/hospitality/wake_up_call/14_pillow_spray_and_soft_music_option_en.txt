Turndown service can add a light lavender pillow spray upon request. The wake‑up system provides standard ring tones only; soft music can be arranged through an in‑room speaker preset by housekeeping the night before. Notes can be added in the folio for paired services.

user:
Hi! Could I get a gentle wake—maybe lavender and soft music at 7:30?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain pillow spray and music via in‑room preset; wake system tones standard.

assistant channel=final:
We can add a lavender pillow spray at turndown and have housekeeping preset your in‑room speaker for soft music. I’ll set your wake call for 7:30 AM; the phone tone is standard, and the music will start via the preset.

user:
Could you send the fragrance ingredient list and the speaker preset profile specs?

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Acknowledged—those ingredient and preset details are being obtained.
