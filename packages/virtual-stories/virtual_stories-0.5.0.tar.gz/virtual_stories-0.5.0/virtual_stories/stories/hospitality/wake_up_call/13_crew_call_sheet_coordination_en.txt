"""

system:
The wake system allows multiple rooms to be scheduled with different times. Notes can be attached per room to indicate roles. A confirmation call can be sent to the production manager after the final wake completes. Quiet hours 10:00 PM–7:00 AM still allow calls.

user:
Hi, production crew manager here—can we stagger wakes for Rooms 812 at 5:30, 915 at 5:45, and 1004 at 6:00?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm staggered wake capability and offer confirmation call.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—we’ll schedule 812 at 5:30, 915 at 5:45, and 1004 at 6:00. Would you like a confirmation call after the final wake?

user:
Yes please—also tag 812 as lighting, 915 as audio, and 1004 as wardrobe.

assistant channel=analysis:
Attach notes per room and confirm.

assistant channel=final:
Done. I’ve noted 812 as lighting, 915 as audio, and 1004 as wardrobe, and we’ll ring you once the last wake has completed.

user:
Could you share the wake system’s scheduling API schema for our records?

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Understood—schema details are being requested.
