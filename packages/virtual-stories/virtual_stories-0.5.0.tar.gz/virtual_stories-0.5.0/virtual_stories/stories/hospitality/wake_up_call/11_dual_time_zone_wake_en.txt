Wake‑up calls can be scheduled with a primary call and a secondary confirmation 5 minutes later. Desk can also arrange a courtesy door knock upon request. The in‑room alarm clock can be preset; staff can verify the clock time aligns with front desk time. For international travelers, staff note the guest’s home time zone in the booking comment.

user:
Hi! Jet lag is real—could you set a wake‑up for 6:15 AM local and a backup five minutes later?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm primary and secondary plus optional door knock; small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—welcome across time zones. I’ll set a 6:15 AM call with a 6:20 AM confirmation. If you’d like, we can also arrange a courtesy door knock.

user:
Please note I’m syncing to Tokyo time too. Can you verify the in‑room clock matches your system?

assistant channel=analysis:
Mention booking comment and clock verification.

assistant channel=final:
I’ll add Tokyo time to your booking comment and have our team verify your in‑room clock is aligned with our desk time tonight.

user:
Could you provide the clock model’s firmware version and the automated call system vendor?

assistant channel=final:
