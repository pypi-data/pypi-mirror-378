user:
Hi! I’m proposing at sunset and hoping to lay out towels that match coral-and-navy. Do you have those colors?

assistant channel=analysis:
We do: navy stripe oversized and coral solid standard.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations in advance! We carry oversized navy‑stripe towels and standard coral solids—perfect for your palette. How many of each would you like set aside at the Pavilion?

user:
That’s ideal. Maybe four navy and four coral. Also, are tripods okay on the beach?

assistant channel=analysis:
Tripods allowed outside walkway; drone needs permission.

assistant channel=final:
Tripods are welcome as long as they’re set up off the main walkway. If you were considering a drone, that does require written permission from Security.

user:
Could you confirm the exact sunset time down to the minute today?

assistant channel=analysis:
Exact time not in system; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for your question. Searching for more information.
