Hi there! We’re planning a little sunset picnic with our twins. Could we pick up some extra towels to use as blankets?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm towel policy and availability; mention oversized towels and pickup times from Pavilion.

assistant channel=final:
That sounds lovely! Each registered guest has a towel token, and you can exchange as often as you like until 19:30 at the Beach Towel Pavilion. For a picnic-style setup, our oversized navy‑stripe towels work best. Would you like two adult oversized and two kid‑size seahorse towels to start?

user:
Yes please—and can we borrow a beach wagon? We’ve got snacks and a kite.

assistant channel=analysis:
Wagons are complimentary, first-come, and available at the Pavilion. Offer insulated picnic tote and phone pouches as well.

assistant channel=final:
We have complimentary beach wagons at the Pavilion on a first‑come basis. I can also set aside an insulated picnic tote and sand‑safe phone pouches for you—shall I bundle those with your towels for pickup?

user:
Sweet! Also, what time does the takeout window open at Sunset Grill?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer directly from system dining hours.

assistant channel=final:
The Sunset Grill takeout window opens at 16:30 and runs through 20:30. Their kids menu is available there as well.

user:
Thanks! One more thing—could you tell me the current UV index on the beach right now before we head out?

assistant channel=analysis:
UV index is not provided in system. This is beyond system context; invoke special flag and end.

[ATTENTION] Thanks for your question. Searching for more information.
