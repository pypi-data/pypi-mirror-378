user:
Hey! If I hit the water around 6 AM, can I still grab a towel somewhere? The pavilion looks closed then.

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain after-hours towel pickup at Front Desk; confirm token policy.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—you can pick up towels from us at the Front Desk before 07:00. Just bring your room number so we can check your towel token. When you’re done, drop used towels in the yellow bins or return them here if it’s still before Pavilion hours.

user:
Nice. Do the boardwalk rinse showers work that early?

assistant channel=analysis:
Rinse showers 24/7 per system.

assistant channel=final:
They do—those rinse showers by the East Beach boardwalk operate 24/7, so you’ll be set after your session.

user:
Appreciate it. Also, what are the expected surf heights at the south reef this morning?

assistant channel=analysis:
Surf forecast is beyond system context; close with special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for your question. Searching for more information.
