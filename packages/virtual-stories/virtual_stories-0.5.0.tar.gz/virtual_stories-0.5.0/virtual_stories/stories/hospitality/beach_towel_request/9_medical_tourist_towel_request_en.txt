Hello! I'm recovering from a procedure and thought some gentle pool time might help. Could I get a couple of towels?

Two towels are ready for you at the thermal spa area. For gentle recovery activities, I recommend our morning meditation sessions at 9 AM, or the restorative yoga class at 11 AM. Our nutritionist can also create a personalized recovery meal plan if you're interested. The garden area is perfect for quiet reflection with beautiful mountain views.

user:
The meditation session sounds perfect for my recovery. Could you sign me up for tomorrow morning?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest wants to join the meditation session. I should arrange their participation.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! I've registered you for the 9 AM meditation session tomorrow in the garden pavilion. It's very gentle and focuses on breathing and relaxation, perfect for post-treatment recovery. The session lasts about 30 minutes and is led by our wellness specialist. Would you like me to arrange for a light breakfast to be brought to your room afterward?

user:
Yes, that would be lovely. Thank you for being so thoughtful about my recovery.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest appreciates the care. I should confirm the breakfast arrangement and ensure they feel supported.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! I've arranged for a light recovery breakfast to be delivered to your room at 9:45 AM. It will include fresh fruits, herbal teas, and gentle Swiss specialties. If you need anything else during your recovery stay, please don't hesitate to ask. We're here to support your healing journey.
