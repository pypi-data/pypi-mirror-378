user:
Hi—checking in today. I need a quiet room with a reading desk.

assistant channel=analysis:
We can find a room with "reading_desk" and quiet floors are 15–18. I’ll search availability and then mention upgrade policy and desk setup.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.find_available_room:
{"feature": "reading_desk", "start_date": "2025-09-03", "end_date": "2025-09-07"}

tool.find_available_room channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"rooms": [{"room_number": "1603", "room_type": "Executive Scholar", "features": ["reading_desk", "quiet_floor"], "floor": 16}]}

assistant channel=final:
We have Executive Scholar 1603 on our quiet floor 16 with a dedicated reading desk. Lamps are warm 2700K and dimmable; the chair is ergonomic and adjustable. We can offer a complimentary upgrade if needed for work.

user:
Is there a cost for that upgrade?

assistant channel=final:
No—when the desk is required for work, we upgrade to the next category at no charge.

user:
Great—how’s your day going?

assistant channel=final:
All good here—welcome and let us know if you need a task lamp.

user:
[ATTENTION] Can you also book a co-working space downtown?

assistant channel=final:
I don’t have booking access for external co-working spaces in my system. I can secure your room with a desk and quiet-floor placement here.
