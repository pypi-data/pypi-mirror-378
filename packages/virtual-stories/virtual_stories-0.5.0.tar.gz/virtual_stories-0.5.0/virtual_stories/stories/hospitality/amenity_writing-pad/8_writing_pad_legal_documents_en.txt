user:
This is perfect! LA's legal scene is so competitive. By the way, what's your favorite local business networking event?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about networking events. This doesn't require specific information from my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! Los Angeles has a dynamic business community. I don't have personal favorites since I focus on corporate services, but many professionals enjoy the various networking events in the downtown area.

user:
Actually, I was wondering about the history of corporate law firms in Los Angeles and how the legal industry evolved here.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the history of corporate law firms in LA, which is detailed historical information not available in my basic system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research the history of corporate law in Los Angeles.

assistant channel=analysis:
I should offer alternative assistance while the information is being gathered.

assistant channel=final:
While I look into that, I can tell you that Los Angeles has been a major legal hub since the early 20th century. If you'd like, I can provide information about current business services or help arrange meetings with local professionals.
