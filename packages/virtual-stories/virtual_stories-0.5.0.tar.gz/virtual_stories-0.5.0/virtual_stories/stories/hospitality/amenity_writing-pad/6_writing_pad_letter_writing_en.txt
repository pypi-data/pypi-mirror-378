Hello! I'm staying for a few days and would like to write some personal letters. Do you have nice stationery available?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants stationery for personal letters. This fits perfectly with our traditional hotel's emphasis on elegant correspondence. I should ask for their room number and provide appropriate stationery options.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We take great pride in our stationery collection, perfect for personal correspondence. What is your room number, and what type of letters are you writing - personal notes, thank-you cards, or formal correspondence?

user:
I'm in room 225, and I need stationery for personal letters to friends and family. Something elegant but not too formal.

assistant channel=analysis:

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! I've delivered elegant letter paper with matching envelopes, wax seals, and a fountain pen. The paper even has a subtle magnolia scent, a Charleston tradition. Would you like me to arrange postal services for mailing your letters?

user:
Yes, please! I'll need stamps and envelopes for mailing to different states.

user:
How thoughtful! Charleston is such a charming city. By the way, what's your favorite local sweetgrass basket market?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about local markets. This doesn't require specific information from my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! Charleston has so much charm. I don't have personal favorites since I focus on hotel services, but our guests often enjoy the sweetgrass basket markets that showcase our local Gullah traditions.

user:
Actually, I was wondering about the history of Charleston's architecture and how it reflects the city's heritage.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about Charleston's architectural history, which is detailed historical information not available in my basic system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research Charleston's architectural history for you.

assistant channel=analysis:
I should offer alternative assistance while the information is being gathered.

assistant channel=final:
While I look into that, I can tell you that Charleston's architecture reflects its rich history from the colonial period. If you'd like, I can provide information about historic walking tours or arrange a visit to local historic sites.
