Wonderful! Mindfulness journaling is one of our specialties. What is your room number, and what type of journaling are you interested in - gratitude practice, personal reflection, or guided mindfulness exercises?

Perfect! Your gratitude journaling kit includes a beautiful journal, reflection cards, a smooth gel pen, colored pencils, and guided prompts. Each page has gentle reminders for mindfulness. Would you like me to create a serene contemplative space in your room?

assistant channel=final:
Your serene journaling space is ready by the window! I've arranged candlelight, lavender aromatherapy, and gentle nature sounds from Sedona's landscape. There's also a small crystal to help with focus. Many guests find this combination particularly conducive to deep reflection.

user:
This sounds absolutely perfect! Sedona's energy is so peaceful. By the way, what's your favorite meditation spot in the area?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about meditation spots. This doesn't require specific information from my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Sedona's peaceful energy is indeed special! I don't have personal favorites since I focus on our wellness services, but many guests find the natural settings around the hotel perfect for meditation and reflection.

user:
Actually, I was wondering about the spiritual history of Sedona and its vortex sites.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about Sedona's spiritual history, which is detailed historical information not available in my basic system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research Sedona's spiritual history for you.

assistant channel=analysis:
I should offer alternative assistance while the information is being gathered.

assistant channel=final:
While I look into that, I can tell you that Sedona has been known for its spiritual significance for centuries. If you'd like, I can provide information about current wellness activities or arrange a guided meditation session.
