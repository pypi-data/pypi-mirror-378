I can’t find the ice bucket in 914. Where should it be, and can I get a replacement with tongs?

It’s usually in the wardrobe cabinet on the upper shelf, with the tongs inside the bucket. I’ve arranged a replacement for 914—ETA about 19 minutes. Ref LVC-ICE-914-22.

The lake looked glassy this morning.

It’s a calm view when the water’s that still.

What brand are the buckets?

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’ll check on the brand details.
