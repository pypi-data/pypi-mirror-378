End of the corridor, please—jet lag is brutal.

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer x31 or x32 on floors 6–8; confirm DND.

assistant channel=final:
We can do an end-of-corridor room—x31 or x32—on a higher floor. Shall I set Do Not Disturb until 14:00 so you can adjust your sleep?

user:
Yes, 14:00 works. Are the stairwell doors noisy?

assistant channel=analysis:
State soft-close minimal noise.

assistant channel=final:
They’re soft-close doors with dampers, so noise is minimal at the ends. We’ll place you away from ice and vending as well.

user:
Thanks—and nice lobby by the way.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk compliment reply.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—we’re glad you like it. I’ll finalize an x31 room at the corridor end and note DND until 14:00.
