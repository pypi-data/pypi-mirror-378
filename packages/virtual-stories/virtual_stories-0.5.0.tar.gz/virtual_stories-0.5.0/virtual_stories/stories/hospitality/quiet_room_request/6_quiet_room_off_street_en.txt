Hotel: Garden Court Midtown, 72 Willow Street, New York, NY.
Facts:
- Courtyard-facing rooms are even-numbered x20–x28; street-facing are odd x11–x19.
- Avoid mechanical rooms near x02–x04; ice machine near x18.
- Nighttime traffic heaviest 22:00–01:00 on Willow St; sirens more common on the avenue side.
- Housekeeping can shift to post-15:00 upon request for late sleepers.

user:
I’m hoping for a courtyard view—street noise keeps me up.

assistant channel=analysis:
Recommend even-numbered x20–x28; avoid x18 near ice.

assistant channel=final:
We can place you on the courtyard side—rooms x20–x28 are the quietest. I’ll avoid x18 where the ice machine sits and keep you clear of mechanical rooms.

user:
Could I be mid-corridor too? Fewer footsteps.

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer mid-corridor selection.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—mid-corridor in that range is a great choice for quiet. Would floor 9 or 10 work?

user:
Either is fine. Thanks for taking care of this.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk reply.

assistant channel=final:
You’re very welcome. We’ll keep things peaceful so you can rest.

user:
One more thing—can housekeeping come later in the day?

assistant channel=final:
Yes, I’ll schedule housekeeping after 15:00 to ensure your morning stays undisturbed.
