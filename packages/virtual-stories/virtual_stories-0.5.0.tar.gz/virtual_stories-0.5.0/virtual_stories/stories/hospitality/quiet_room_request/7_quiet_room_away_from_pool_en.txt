user:
Could you keep us well away from the pool? My kid crashes early.

assistant channel=analysis:
Recommend West Wing x22–x28; emphasize distance from pool.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—our West Wing on floors 3–5, rooms x22–x28, is farthest from the pool courtyard and stays calm into the evening. Would a garden-view room there suit you?

user:
Garden view sounds nice. Any chance we’ll hear the kids movie night?

assistant channel=analysis:
State movie nights end 20:30 and distance minimizes sound.

assistant channel=final:
Movie nights are Friday and Saturday and wrap by 20:30. From West Wing x22–x28, the sound rarely carries—your early bedtime should be undisturbed.

user:
Great. Also, do the hallways get noisy at night?

assistant channel=analysis:
Quiet Hours policy exists; mention patrols.

assistant channel=final:
Quiet Hours run 21:00–07:00 with active patrols. If you notice any noise, call us and we’ll address it promptly.

user:
Thanks! Long day at the beach.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk reply.

assistant channel=final:
Sounds like a full day—let’s make it a peaceful night. I’ve assigned a West Wing garden-view room away from the pool.
