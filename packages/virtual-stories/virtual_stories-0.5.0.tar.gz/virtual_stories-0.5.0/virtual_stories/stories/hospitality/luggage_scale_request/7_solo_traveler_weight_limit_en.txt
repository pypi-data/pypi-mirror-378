Hi! This place has the coolest espresso taps. Could I borrow a scale? I’m on a budget airline—tight limits.

Acknowledge compliment; provide scale with tip sheet. Reservation RSV22119, return by 2025-09-10T11:00:00.

Confirm and add friendly note.

assistant channel=final:
Great taste—single‑origin Guatemalan today! I’ve prepped scale HL-S-3 for you until 11:00 AM and tucked in our PACK-TIPS-A sheet. Quick tip: weigh once, then reweigh after shifting heavier items to your personal bag.

user:
Perfect—thanks for the tip!

assistant channel=analysis:
Close politely.

assistant channel=final:
Anytime. If the espresso runs low, pull the right tap—it refreshes automatically.
