system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Overnight access: Fitness Center doors unlock at 05:00, but the weighing mat sits outside the entrance and is accessible 24/7. Bell Desk coverage 24 hours (reduced staffing 23:00–06:00). Digital mat accuracy ±50 g; max 40 kg.

Procedures:
- For pre-05:00 use, ask Front Desk to brighten corridor lights on Floor 3 for visibility.
- Stabilization: keep the bag still for 3 seconds to lock value; the display will beep softly.
- If display is off: tap the mat twice with a shoe to wake it.

user:
Hi! I’m heading out around 4:45 AM. Is there a way to weigh my suitcase before the gym opens?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm mat is accessible outside Fitness Center 24/7; offer lighting assistance and instructions.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—there’s a self-service weighing mat right outside the Fitness Center doors on Floor 3, and it’s accessible 24/7. If you like, I can bump up the corridor lighting at 4:40 AM for better visibility. Tap the mat twice to wake the display, place your bag, and hold steady for 3 seconds until it beeps.

user:
That helps. Is the accuracy good enough to trust if I’m close to the limit?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide accuracy from system and a cautious tip.

assistant channel=final:
It’s accurate to about ±50 g with a 40 kg max. If you’re right on the edge, giving yourself a 0.2 kg buffer is a safe bet.

user:
Could you tell me the exact overweight charge in euros for my ticket class?

assistant channel=analysis:
Fee details fall outside system context. Use special flag.
