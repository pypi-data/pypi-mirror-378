Hi… my checked bag is 2 lbs over. Loving the citrus water, but I’m stressing.

Reassure; offer tote and scale. Reservation RSV88310. Return by 2025-09-10T17:00:00.

Give practical advice grounded in system prompt amenities.

assistant channel=final:
You’ve got this. I’ve signed out scale DS-S-4 and a TOTE-DS-01 tote until 5:00 PM. Try moving paper or books to the tote as a personal item—and the 3rd‑floor coin laundry has a folding table if you want space to repack.

user:
That helps—thank you.

assistant channel=final:
Happy to help. I’ll check in at 4:45 PM to see if you need more time.
