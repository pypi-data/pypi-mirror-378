Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Poolside Movie Night 19:30–21:15. Safety: no open flames on deck; battery candles permitted. Small celebrations welcome at the back-row tables; keep walkways clear. Outside cake discouraged; pastry kiosk offers mini-cakes.

user:
Could we sing happy birthday by the pool screen and set up a tiny cake?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain safety and celebration policy.

assistant channel=final:
We’d love to help celebrate. Let’s use a back-row table so you’re out of the main walkway, and we’ll swap real candles for battery candles—open flames aren’t allowed on deck. The pastry kiosk has mini-cakes that travel well if you prefer not to bring one in.

user:
Could you display a custom birthday slide on the screen before the movie?

assistant channel=analysis:
Custom slides beyond context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Sounds festive—we’re checking that screen cue option now.
