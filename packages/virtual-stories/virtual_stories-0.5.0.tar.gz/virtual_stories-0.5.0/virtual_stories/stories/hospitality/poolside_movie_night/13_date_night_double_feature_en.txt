system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Standard program 19:30–21:15 single feature. Pool bar operates until 21:30 with quiet order pickup to keep the audio clear. No glass on deck—drinks in acrylic only.

user:
Any chance of a double-feature tonight? And will the bar serve throughout?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide standard runtime and bar service policy; small talk.

assistant channel=final:
The usual format is a single feature from 19:30 to about 21:15. The pool bar serves through 21:30 with quiet pickup so the soundtrack stays crisp. We pour into acrylic—no glass on deck—but the spritzers are lovely under the lights.

user:
Could you extend the show to include a late second film if we have a group?

assistant channel=analysis:
Extensions are beyond context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Noted—that extended program request is being evaluated now.
