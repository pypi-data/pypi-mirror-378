Hi! Do you have small binder clips? And what’s the complimentary limit for students?

We have small 19mm clips—64 available, including white-coated. How many should I reserve, and is room delivery or pickup better for you?

user:
Room 915, pickup is fine. Set aside 10 white-coated ones please. Also, love the 24/7 study tables here.

assistant channel=final:
Glad they’re useful—those power hubs are popular during conferences.
