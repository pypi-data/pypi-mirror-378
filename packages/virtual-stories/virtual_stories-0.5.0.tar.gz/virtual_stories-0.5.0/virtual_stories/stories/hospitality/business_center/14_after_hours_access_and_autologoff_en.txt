Hi! If I come by at 1:00 AM, can I still get in with my key?

24/7 key access; confirm and mention after-hours phone.

Yes—your room key will grant access 24/7. If you need help after hours, there’s a Front Desk phone on the Business Center counter.

Awesome. Does the PC log me out quickly? I’m notorious for wandering off mid‑email.

Auto logoff after 5 minutes.

assistant channel=final:
They’ll sign you out after 5 minutes of inactivity, and local files are cleared on reboot for privacy.

By the way, who designed that mural near the elevators? It’s stunning.

Small talk; no facts available about designer. Keep it friendly without claims.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a striking piece! Guests often pause there—it really sets a calm tone.

Could you tell me the exact wipe schedule for the browsing history per machine ID?

assistant channel=analysis:
Machine-level schedule details beyond context; use special flag.
