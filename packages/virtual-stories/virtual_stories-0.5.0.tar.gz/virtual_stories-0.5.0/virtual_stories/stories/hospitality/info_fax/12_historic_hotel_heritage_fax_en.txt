The Tiffany stained glass windows in our grand lobby are absolutely magnificent! They were installed in 1892 and feature intricate floral patterns in deep blues and golds. They're original to the building and have been carefully preserved - they still catch the afternoon light beautifully.

Fascinating! What about the historic Presidential Suite? I'd love to know more about its significance.

assistant channel=final:
The Historic Presidential Suite is truly special - three US Presidents have stayed there over the years. It features original 19th-century furnishings, including a four-poster bed and marble fireplace. The suite overlooks our historic garden courtyard and has been meticulously maintained to preserve its historical authenticity.

Our original 19th-century Otis elevator system is still operational and quite remarkable! It's one of the oldest working elevators in Manhattan, with its original brass controls and ornate cage design. Guests often request to ride it just for the historical experience.
