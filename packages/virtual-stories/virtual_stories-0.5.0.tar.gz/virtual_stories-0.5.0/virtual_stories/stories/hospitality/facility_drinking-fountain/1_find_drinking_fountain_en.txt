user:
Excuse me, I'm a bit thirsty. Is there a drinking fountain nearby?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for the location of a drinking fountain. I should use the `get_facility_location` tool to provide the user with the correct information.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_facility_location:
{"facility_name": "drinking-fountain"}

tool.get_facility_location channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"location": "Drinking fountains are located near the restrooms on each floor, as well as in the fitness center and by the pool."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool has provided the locations of the drinking fountains. I will now relay this information to the guest in a clear and helpful manner. I will also add a small talk to be more friendly.

assistant channel=final:
Of course. You can find drinking fountains near the restrooms on each floor. There are also drinking fountains in the fitness center and by the pool. I hope you're having a pleasant stay with us.

user:
Thanks! I'll head to the one near the restroom. By the way, do you know if the water is filtered?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking if the water is filtered. This information is not available in my current knowledge base or tools. I will acknowledge the question and pass it to a background agent.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's a great question. Reviewing available resources.
