Hi, I'm curious about your emergency water access procedures. What happens if there's a power outage or system failure?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about emergency water access procedures. According to the system prompt, we have emergency protocols with backup water systems activated within 30 seconds of main system failure, with 48-hour emergency water storage capacity. I should explain these safety measures.

assistant channel=final:
Great question! We have comprehensive emergency protocols in place. Our backup water systems activate within 30 seconds of any main system failure, and we maintain 48-hour emergency water storage capacity to ensure continuous access to clean water for all guests.

That's very reassuring! How many backup systems do you have?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the number of backup systems. While I know we have backup water systems that activate within 30 seconds and 48-hour emergency water storage capacity, I don't have specific information about the exact number of backup systems. This goes beyond the available system knowledge.

I understand. Can you tell me where the emergency water stations are located?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the location of emergency water stations. From the system prompt, I know we have 47 strategically placed hydration stations across 8 floors, including premium locations in our spa, fitness center, and beachfront cabanas. However, I don't have specific information about which of these serve as emergency stations or if there are additional emergency-specific locations. This goes beyond the available system knowledge.

Do you have any special procedures for guests with medical conditions who might need immediate access to water?

While I know we have emergency protocols and backup systems, I don't have specific information about medical accommodation procedures for water access.
