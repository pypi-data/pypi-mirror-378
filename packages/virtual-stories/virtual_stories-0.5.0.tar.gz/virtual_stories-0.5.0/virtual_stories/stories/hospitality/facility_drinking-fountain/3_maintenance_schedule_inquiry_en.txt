user:
Hi there! I'm curious about your drinking fountains. How often do you maintain them? I noticed one near the pool area seemed to have a different taste this morning.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about maintenance schedules for drinking fountains, which is information I have in my system prompt. They also mentioned a taste difference, which could be related to recent maintenance. I should provide the detailed maintenance information from my knowledge base.

assistant channel=final:
Great question! We take water quality very seriously here at Aqua Vista. Our drinking fountains undergo comprehensive maintenance on a strict schedule. We perform daily sanitization at 6:00 AM, weekly filter replacement every Monday, monthly UV bulb replacement, quarterly system calibration, and annual comprehensive service. Our team of 8 certified water treatment specialists also performs routine checks every 4 hours during operating hours. The taste difference you noticed near the pool area is likely due to our weekly filter replacement that occurred this morning - the new filters can sometimes impart a slightly different mineral profile for the first few hours. This is completely normal and safe. The water quality is continuously monitored with hourly testing, and results are displayed on the digital screens at each station.

user:
That's very thorough! What kind of filters do you use?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about the specific type of filters used. This information is not provided in my system prompt, so I need to use the ATTENTION flag to indicate I need to gather more information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's an excellent technical question. Reviewing available resources.
