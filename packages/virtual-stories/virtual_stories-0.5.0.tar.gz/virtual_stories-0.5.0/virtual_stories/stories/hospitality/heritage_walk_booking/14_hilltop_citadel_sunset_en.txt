Hello! The rooftop bar view is stunning. Is there a hotel shuttle to the East Rampart Gate before the sunset walk?

Shuttle details.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—our shuttle runs on tour days at 18:20 and 19:05 from the hotel entrance to the East Rampart Gate. Seats are for 10 guests on a first‑come basis.

user:
Is the climb steep? My knee is fine on short inclines but not long ones.

assistant channel=analysis:
Gradient info.

assistant channel=final:
The walk to the Gate averages 5–6% with one short 9% pitch. The tour itself keeps gradients moderate, and there’s a bypass if high winds close the parapet.

user:
What’s the refund policy if we cancel last minute?

Could you broadcast the guide’s audio over the city’s public safety channel so my scanner can pick it up?

Beyond scope—special flag.
