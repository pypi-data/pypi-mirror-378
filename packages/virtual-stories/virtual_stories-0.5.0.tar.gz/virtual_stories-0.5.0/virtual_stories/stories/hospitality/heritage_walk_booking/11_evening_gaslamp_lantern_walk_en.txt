Great. We’ve got my mom with us—she uses a rollator. Are there stairs on the route?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer with accessibility specifics and ramp detours.

assistant channel=final:
The route keeps grades at or below 4% and has curb cuts at all crossings. There are two optional stair segments (12 and 7 steps), and each one has a signed ramp detour so your mom can stay on a step‑free path the whole time. We can also provide wireless audio receivers with neck loops if helpful.

user:

If it drizzles, would they cancel?

Weather policy.

assistant channel=final:
Light drizzle is fine—they proceed and offer complimentary ponchos if precipitation is at or below 2 mm/hr. They cancel only for sustained winds over 35 km/h or a lightning advisory.

user:
We’re four adults and one child. Could you quote the total and tell me when the booking cutoff is?

assistant channel=analysis:
Calculate pricing from system and mention booking window.

assistant channel=final:
For four adults and one child under 12, the pre‑tax prices already include the city entertainment levy: 4×$24 + 1×$10 = $106 total. The booking window closes 60 minutes prior to the start time.

user:
Nice. One more thing—can you overlay the exact lantern route onto my personal Strava map in real time?

assistant channel=analysis:
This goes beyond the system context; respond with the special flag without tools.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for the creative idea—examining various angles.
