Our reservation is CHI-1776, and we're a family of five - two adults and three teenagers. We'd love the 9 AM walk to start our day with history.

Perfect! Your 9 AM heritage walk is booked with tour ID HERITAGE-225. Our family-friendly walks are led by expert historians who bring colonial life to life for all ages. The 2-hour walk covers the original settlement, colonial homes, and the town green. Afterward, I can arrange a meeting with our genealogy specialist who can help research your family's colonial connections using our extensive historical records.

That sounds amazing! Our teenagers are usually not interested in history, but this might actually engage them. Do you have any special family activities?

We have several activities designed to engage all ages! Our "Colonial Kids" program includes hands-on activities like candle making, quill pen writing, and colonial games. We also have interactive reenactments where teenagers can participate in historical role-playing. These activities often reveal surprising family connections that make history personal and exciting.

The session includes colonial-era games like ninepins and graces, plus hands-on crafts that will give your teenagers a real taste of 18th-century life. Our experienced interpreters make it educational and entertaining!

This is going to be such a special family experience. My kids are going to love learning about their heritage in such an interactive way.
