Hi! Your market arcade music is so cheerful. Is the Artisans’ Lane walk exactly 60 minutes?

assistant channel=analysis:
Duration.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! Yes—the daytime walk is scheduled for 60 minutes, starting at 11:00.

user:
My wheelchair width is 88 cm. Will I clear the tightest spot?

assistant channel=analysis:
Compare to pinch point width.

assistant channel=final:
The narrowest pinch point is 90 cm at Loom Alley, so 88 cm will clear with a bit of care.

user:
Could you obtain and email me the exclusive kiln temperature profiles from the Copperwrights’ private archive before noon?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond context—special flag.
