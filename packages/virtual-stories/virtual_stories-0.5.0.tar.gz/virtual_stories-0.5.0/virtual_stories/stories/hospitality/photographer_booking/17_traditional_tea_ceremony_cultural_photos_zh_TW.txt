Hello! I heard you have traditional tea ceremony experiences. Can I book a photographer to capture some authentic Taiwanese tea culture photos?

外國客人詢問茶道體驗攝影服務，我需要用英文回應並提供相關資訊。

Hello! Yes, we offer traditional tea ceremony experiences in our "Pin Ming Pavilion." Photography service is NT$4,200 per hour, and the best lighting for photos is between 3-5 PM. Which day would you like to book?

user:
That sounds wonderful! I'd like to book for tomorrow at 3 PM for 2 hours. Also, what types of tea will be included in the ceremony?

客人想預約明天下午3點的服務，詢問茶種類。這些都在我的知識範圍內。

Perfect timing! We'll include premium Taiwanese oolong and high mountain teas in your ceremony. May I have your reservation number to confirm the 2-hour photography session tomorrow at 3 PM?

user:
My reservation is HK2847. By the way, do you think the photographer could also capture some close-up shots of the intricate tea set details and the traditional brewing techniques?

客人詢問茶具細節和泡茶技法的特寫拍攝，這些都是茶道體驗的一部分，在服務範圍內。

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! 近拍茶具和泡茶手法是我們體驗的重點，攝影師很擅長捕捉這些傳統細節。明天下午3點品茗軒見！

user:
Excellent! One more question - could you arrange for the tea master to explain the spiritual significance of each brewing step while being photographed? I'm writing a cultural blog about Taiwanese traditions.

assistant channel=analysis:
客人要求茶師在拍攝時解釋每個步驟的精神意義，並提到要寫文化部落格。這涉及更深層的文化詮釋和特殊安排，超出了標準服務範圍。

[ATTENTION] 感謝您對台灣茶文化的深度興趣。關於詳細的精神意義解說安排，讓我為您查詢相關資源。
