Hi! I'm in room 512 and I'm here for a wellness retreat. I'd love to start a juice cleanse to reset my system. I'm looking for detox and energy boost benefits, maybe a 3-day program that's not too intense since this is my first cleanse.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest in room 512 wants first-time juice cleanse for detox and energy, 3 days, moderate intensity. I should design an appropriate program for a beginner.

Great beginner-friendly program with 5 juices daily, balanced nutrition, and daily nutritionist supervision. I should schedule delivery for their room.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect for your first cleanse! I've designed a gentle 3-day detox and energy program with 5 fresh juices daily: Green Alkalizer at 7 AM, Antioxidant Blast at 10 AM, Digestive Support at 1 PM, Energy Reviver at 4 PM, and Evening Calm at 7 PM. You'll have daily check-ins with our nutritionist. Shall I schedule delivery to room 512?

That sounds wonderful and very manageable! Yes, please schedule the deliveries. I love that you include a nutritionist check-in.

That's wonderful to hear! I'm curious - do you grow all the vegetables and fruits here on the property?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about our growing operations and sourcing. I can share information about our hydroponic greenhouse that I mentioned in the system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
We grow many ingredients right here! Our hydroponic greenhouse produces wheatgrass, microgreens, and herbs year-round. For fruits and larger vegetables, we partner with local organic farms within 50 miles of Sedona to ensure peak freshness and support the community.

user:
That's amazing! Are there any cooking classes where I could learn to make these healthy juices at home?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about cooking classes to learn juice making. This would require class scheduling and culinary program booking beyond my juice cleanse and delivery tools.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] We do offer healthy cooking workshops! Looking into available classes for juice and smoothie preparation.
