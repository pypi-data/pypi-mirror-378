user:
Hi there! I’m double‑checking my folio over coffee. Is the 12.5% city occupancy tax standard for all nights?

assistant channel=analysis:
The system lists city occupancy tax at 12.5% for all nights; confirm.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the city occupancy tax is 12.5% and applies to each billable night on the room rate and resort fee.

user:
Good to know. I did hand over a government exemption letter when I arrived—would that waive the city tax here?

assistant channel=analysis:
System says exemption letter presented at check‑in waives city occupancy tax; state tax still applies.

assistant channel=final:
Correct—when a verified exemption letter is presented at check‑in, the city occupancy tax is waived. State tax of 6.0% still applies.

user:
Nice. Could we split the folio so my company card covers room and resort fee, and my personal card covers the café charges?

assistant channel=analysis:
System allows split between room vs incidentals at checkout.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely. We can split room and resort fee to your company card and move incidentals like café charges to your personal card.

user:
By the way, can you send me a VAT‑compliant invoice for my UK accounting?

assistant channel=analysis:
System says VAT not applicable; beyond system to produce VAT invoice; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for your request about a VAT-compliant invoice. Reviewing available resources.
