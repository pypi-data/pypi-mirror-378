Thanks for waiting—I’ve reviewed your folio. I refunded the $18 minibar charge and emailed an updated receipt to chen@example.com. The late checkout fee was recorded at 1:05 PM per policy; I can apply a 25% goodwill credit at your next stay. Does that work for you, or would you prefer a manager call?
