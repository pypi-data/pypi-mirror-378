user:
Good evening! Long day—thanks for staying open late. Can you split my bill so room and taxes go to my corporate card, and the minibar and spa go to my personal?

assistant channel=analysis:
System supports split folio as requested.

assistant channel=final:
Yes. I’ll place room and taxes on the corporate card on file and move minibar and spa to your personal card. We can also email separate folios.

user:
That’d be great. Please send the room folio to travel@myco.com and the personal one to my Gmail.

assistant channel=analysis:
System allows up to 3 addresses per folio.

assistant channel=final:
Done. Room folio to travel@myco.com, and personal folio to your Gmail. We can add another address if you’d like.

user:
Quick question while I grab a tea—can you charge me in euros instead to save conversion fees?

assistant channel=analysis:
System states USD only, no DCC. This is in‑context; answer directly.

assistant channel=final:
All billing here is in USD, and we don’t offer dynamic currency conversion.

user:
Could you also provide a line‑level export in CSV for my expense app?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system offering; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about a CSV line-level export. Checking available options.
