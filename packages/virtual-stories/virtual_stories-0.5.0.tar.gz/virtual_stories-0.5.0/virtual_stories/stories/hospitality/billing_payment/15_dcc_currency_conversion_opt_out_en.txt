user:
Hello! I was hoping to have my card charged in CAD—can you do that here?

assistant channel=analysis:
System states USD only; answer directly.

assistant channel=final:
We settle all transactions in USD and don’t support charging in other currencies.

user:
All right. Could you at least note the tourism fee amount on my folio footer?

assistant channel=analysis:
System says email folio footer includes currency disclaimer; tourism fee exists; we can ensure it’s shown.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the folio will show local occupancy tax of 14% and the $3 per night tourism fee in the totals section.

user:
By the way, the lobby art is fantastic!

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—our collection rotates quarterly with local artists.

user:
Could you issue a same‑day refund to a different card instead of the original?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond policy; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Understood about refund routing to a different card. Checking available options.
