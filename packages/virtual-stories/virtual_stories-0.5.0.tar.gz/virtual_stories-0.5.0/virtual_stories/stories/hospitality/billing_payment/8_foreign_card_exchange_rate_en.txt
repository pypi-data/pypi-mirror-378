Hello! The lobby music was delightful. I noticed the $300 room charge on my bank statement converted to more euros than expected. Reservation RSV-2025-0720-8890, last name García. Can you clarify?

The room charge on our side was $300 USD, and your bank applied its own exchange rate to euros. I’ve emailed a copy of the folio to garcia@example.es for your records. Let me know if you’d like me to speak with your bank.
