Hi! The mountain art is cozy. How long until the bathroom floor feels warm?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; 30–45 minutes radiant; bathroom warmer has 60‑minute timer.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a radiant system, so please allow about 30–45 minutes for the tiles to feel warm. The bathroom floor warmer has a 60‑minute timer you can activate independently.
