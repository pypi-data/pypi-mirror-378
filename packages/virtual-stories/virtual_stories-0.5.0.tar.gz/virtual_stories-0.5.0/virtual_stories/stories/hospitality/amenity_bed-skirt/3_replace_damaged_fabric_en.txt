Service Policy:
- Damaged textiles are replaced same day during 09:00–18:00 windows.
- Styles follow room type; minimalist in studios, pleated in suites.

Article A — Materials:
We use durable blends that resist pilling; a snag triggers a full swap to preserve presentation.

Article B — Workflow:
Runner removes the skirt, housekeeping vacuums along the base, and the new piece is steamed before fitting.

Article C — Setting:
Rooms face calm lakeside streets; evenings are quiet with soft shoreline light.

Article D — Inventory:
Sizes and colors are stocked per floor for quick turns.

Article E — Comfort:
Neutral palettes keep spaces restful after long days.

Chitchat referencing setting.

The lakeside light here helps set that calm tone in the evenings.

user:
Do studios here usually get the minimalist style?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from Service Policy.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—studios use the minimalist style, and suites typically get pleated for a softer look.

user:
Any chance you know if the lake fireworks show is happening tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Understood. Checking available options.

Thanks!
