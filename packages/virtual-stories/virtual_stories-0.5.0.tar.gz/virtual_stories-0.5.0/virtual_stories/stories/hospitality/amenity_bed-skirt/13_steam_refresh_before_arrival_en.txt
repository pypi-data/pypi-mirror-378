I’ll arrive around 5 PM. Could you steam and tidy the bed skirt beforehand?

assistant channel=analysis:
Fits standard prep window 16:00–18:00; confirm steps and non-fragrance policy.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we’ll do a standard prep between 4–6 PM: quick handheld steam (distilled water), corner clip recheck, and a final smooth so the drop sits at 11 inches. We’ll mark the prep on your door card.

user:
Nice. Do you use scented sprays?

assistant channel=analysis:
Policy says no fragrance.

assistant channel=final:
No, we keep it fragrance‑free and use only distilled water.

user:
Can you also arrange airport pickup at 4:30?

assistant channel=analysis:
Airport pickup not in system; use ATTENTION flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Understood. Looking up options.

user:
Great, thanks.
