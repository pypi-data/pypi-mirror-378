Hi, could I switch to a box‑pleat bed skirt in room 732? The tailored one looks a bit too modern for me.

assistant channel=analysis:
Check availability for bed size/color, then schedule upgrade.

Certainly—we have an ivory queen box‑pleat in stock. Andre will install and steam it at 1:45 PM (service UPG‑BOX‑732) for that classic heritage look.

user:
Wonderful. The courtyard fountain sounds lovely from here.

assistant channel=analysis:
Chitchat linked to setting.

assistant channel=final:
It adds a gentle hush—the insulated shutters keep the rooms serene.

user:
Will the ivory match the curtain trim?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from coordination article.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we match skirt tones to the curtain trims so the ensemble feels cohesive.

Do you know which clubs have live brass bands tonight?
