Hi—can you make the bed skirt in 1512 child-safe? My toddler keeps tugging on it.

assistant channel=analysis:
We can shorten drop and secure with clips within PM wave. Confirm reduced drop and safety policy details.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely. We’ll set a reduced drop to 9 inches, secure each side with low‑profile clips, and verify there’s no fabric touching the floor. Would you like this done during our 5–8 PM housekeeping window?

user:
Yes, 5:30 PM works. Which fabric do you use?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer using fabric options listed in system. Keep it concise.

assistant channel=final:
We can keep the current Oyster White twill or switch to Coastal Beige linen or Graphite brushed microfiber. Do you prefer one of these?

user:
Oyster White is fine. By the way, can you also add a small rug near the balcony?

assistant channel=analysis:
Rugs are not mentioned in the system context; flag ATTENTION.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Noted about the rug. Reviewing available resources.

user:
Do you leave fabric pooling at the corners?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from safety policy and checklist.

assistant channel=final:
No—corners are tucked and secured, with a gap no greater than a quarter inch. We’ll also photograph the setup internally and note it in your stay log.

user:
Thanks!
