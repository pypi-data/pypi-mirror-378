Hi, the bed skirt keeps wrinkling when we move luggage. Can you install wrinkle‑guard clips?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer standard install and steam within window.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we’ll install WRINKLE_GUARD_CLIP v2 (5 per side plus corner supports) and give it a quick steam between 10 AM and 9 PM. Would this afternoon work?

user:
This afternoon is good. What colors are allowed on this wing again?

assistant channel=analysis:
Answer from Extra Details.

assistant channel=final:
Chalk and Driftwood are the two approved colors on this wing.

user:
Can you book me a sailing tour for tomorrow morning?
