Seabreeze Hotel – Parade notes: Some Oceanview Wing rooms on levels 18–20 have partial sightlines to the Spring Blossom Parade route. No amplification devices permitted on balconies; quiet hours 22:00–07:00. Lobby provides event map printouts. Elevators may be busier from 16:30–17:30.

user:
Can we watch the Spring Blossom Parade from our balcony, or should we head downstairs?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain partial views, offer map; small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Depending on your exact room on levels 18–20, you may catch partial views. For the full experience, the street-level viewing zones are better—we have printed maps at the lobby. Either way, it’s a cheerful scene—planning to take photos or just enjoy the music?

user:
We’ll go downstairs. Do balconies allow speakers for the music?

assistant channel=analysis:
No amplification.

assistant channel=final:
We ask that no amplification devices be used on balconies. You’ll hear the parade well at street level.

user:
Could you provide a reserved curbside spot right by the main float for us?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; use flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Reserved curbside placement isn’t described in our materials. Checking available options.
