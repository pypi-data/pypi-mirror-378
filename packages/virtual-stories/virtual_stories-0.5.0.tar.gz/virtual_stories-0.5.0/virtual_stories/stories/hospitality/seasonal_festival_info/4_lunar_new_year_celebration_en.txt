You can catch the lion dances at 10:30 and 16:00 at the Willow Arcade Courtyard—two blocks east of the hotel. Our shuttle drops at Old Gate Arch; it’s a 4‑minute walk from there. If you like photos, the courtyard’s southeast corner gives a nice angle.

By the way, are you more into morning festivities or the evening lanterns?

user:
Evening lanterns! Could you also book dim sum brunch for two at Silk Garden at 12:30 under Mia?

assistant channel=analysis:
Book dining for 2 at 12:30.
