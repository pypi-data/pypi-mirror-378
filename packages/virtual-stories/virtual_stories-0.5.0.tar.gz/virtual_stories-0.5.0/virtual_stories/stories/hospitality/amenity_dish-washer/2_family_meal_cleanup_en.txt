Hi! We're a family of five in Residence Suite 2508. We have three young kids and are doing a lot of cooking. Could you send up some dishwasher pods? We go through them quickly with all the meals and snacks.

assistant channel=analysis:
Family in Residence Suite 2508 needs dishwasher pods for frequent use. This matches our kitchen supplies perfectly. I can use the request_kitchen_supplies tool with multiple pods for family use.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_kitchen_supplies:
{"supply_name": "dishwasher_detergent_pod", "room_number": "2508", "quantity": 6}

tool.request_kitchen_supplies channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "confirmed", "delivery_time": "12 minutes", "message": "Six eco-friendly dishwasher pods are being delivered to Residence Suite 2508."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The kitchen supplies order was successful. I should mention our family amenities since they have young children, as these are available in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Of course! I've ordered six eco-friendly dishwasher pods for your family suite. They will arrive in about 12 minutes. With three little ones, you might also enjoy our complimentary Kids' Club and family pool complex during your stay.

user:
That sounds wonderful. The kids are having a blast here. By the way, what's the best way to load the dishwasher for maximum cleaning efficiency?

assistant channel=analysis:
The parent is asking about dishwasher loading for efficiency, which is chitchat/small talk about kitchen usage. The system prompt provides basic dishwasher information but doesn't include specific loading techniques. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you want tips for efficient dishwasher loading. Let me find some helpful recommendations for you.

user:
Actually, let me ask about the kids' club schedule. The children would love to participate in some activities. What times are available?

assistant channel=analysis:
The parent is asking about kids' club schedule, which is mentioned in the system prompt. I can provide information about this service without needing tools.

assistant channel=final:
Our complimentary Kids' Club offers supervised activities from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily, with age-appropriate programs for children 3-12 years old. Activities include arts and crafts, pool games, story time, and outdoor adventures. We also have teen programs for older children.

user:
Perfect! One more question - are there any family-friendly restaurants nearby that deliver to the resort?

assistant channel=analysis:
The parent is asking about nearby family-friendly restaurants with delivery. The system prompt mentions grocery delivery service and proximity to attractions but doesn't provide specific restaurant information. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'd be happy to help you find family-friendly delivery options. Let me check some local restaurant recommendations for you.
