Hi! I'm painter Elena in Studio Suite 1605. I'm using the dishwasher to clean my paintbrushes and art supplies. Could you send up some gentle detergent? I need to be careful with my delicate brushes.

assistant channel=analysis:
Artist in Studio Suite 1605 needs gentle detergent for cleaning art supplies. This matches our creative supplies perfectly. I can use the request_creative_supplies tool for art-appropriate cleaning products.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_creative_supplies:
{"supply_name": "gentle_art_detergent_pod", "room_number": "1605", "quantity": 3}

tool.request_creative_supplies channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "confirmed", "delivery_time": "14 minutes", "message": "Three gentle detergent pods for art supplies are being delivered to Studio Suite 1605."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The creative supplies order was successful. I should mention our art workshops and studio tours since this guest is a painter on residency, as these are available in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect for your paintbrush cleaning! I've ordered three gentle detergent pods specially formulated for delicate art supplies. They will arrive in about 14 minutes. As a painter, you might also enjoy our art workshops and studio tours during your residency.

user:
That sounds wonderful. I'm really inspired by this creative environment. By the way, what's the gentlest cycle on the dishwasher for cleaning brushes?

assistant channel=analysis:
The artist is asking about the gentlest dishwasher cycle, which is chitchat/small talk about art supply cleaning. The system prompt mentions gentle detergent but doesn't provide specific cycle information. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you need the gentlest cycle for your art supplies. Let me check the available gentle cleaning options for you.

user:
Actually, let me ask about the art workshops. I'd love to participate in some painting sessions. What styles are offered?

assistant channel=analysis:
The artist is asking about art workshop styles, which are mentioned in the system prompt. I can provide information about these creative services without needing tools.

assistant channel=final:
Our art workshops cover various styles including watercolor, oil painting, mixed media, sculpture, and digital art. Classes are offered at different skill levels from beginner to advanced, with both short sessions and multi-week courses. We also have specialized workshops for specific techniques and mediums.

user:
Excellent! One more question - are there any gallery openings or art exhibitions I could attend during my stay?

assistant channel=analysis:
The artist is asking about gallery openings and exhibitions. The system prompt mentions studio tours and exhibition opportunities but doesn't provide specific schedules. This goes beyond the available context, so I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'd be excited to help you find gallery openings and exhibitions. Let me check our current arts calendar for you.
