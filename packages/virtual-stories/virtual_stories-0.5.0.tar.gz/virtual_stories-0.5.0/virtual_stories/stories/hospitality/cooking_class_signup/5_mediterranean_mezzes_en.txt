We're delighted you love the views! Our Mediterranean ingredients are incredibly fresh - we source daily from local farmers for our herbs, olives, and vegetables. Our olive oil comes from our own grove, and the seafood is caught that morning. You'll be cooking with the freshest Mediterranean ingredients available!

For anniversaries, we often arrange private beach dinners with lanterns and rose petals, or sunset yacht cruises. We could also prepare a special dessert with champagne service in your room after the class. What sounds most romantic to you?

A private beach dinner sounds perfect! Could you arrange that for after our class tomorrow? We'll be finished by 7 PM.

This is a request for additional services beyond the cooking class. Based on system knowledge, I can offer to arrange this.

assistant channel=final:
A private beach dinner would be absolutely perfect for your anniversary! I'll arrange a romantic setup on our private beach with lanterns, fresh flowers, and your choice of Mediterranean dishes. It will be ready at 7:30 PM after your class. Would you like me to include champagne and a special dessert?

Yes, that would be lovely! The champagne and dessert sound perfect. How long has the resort been offering these romantic beach dinners?
