The Dom Pérignon sounds perfect for such a special occasion. Can you tell me more about the romantic setup options?

Excellent choice! The Dom Pérignon Vintage 2015 is truly special for a milestone anniversary. For the romantic setup, we can arrange rose petals scattered around your suite, elegant candle lighting for ambiance, and artisanal chocolate truffles to complement the champagne. The service includes professional presentation with an ice bucket and crystal stemware. Our sommelier can also provide complimentary wine pairing recommendations if you're planning dinner. The champagne will be delivered chilled and ready to serve within 15-30 minutes. Would you like me to arrange the full romantic package for your anniversary celebration?

user:
That sounds absolutely perfect! We're also planning to have dinner at your restaurant later.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is small talk about their dinner plans. I can acknowledge this and provide information about the fine dining restaurant mentioned in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful! Our Michelin-starred restaurant has an extensive wine cellar that pairs beautifully with our champagne selection. The sommelier can recommend the perfect wine pairings for your anniversary dinner, and you can enjoy the oceanfront views from your private balcony before heading to dinner. The romantic setup will be ready when you return to your suite.

user:
What's the serving temperature for the Dom Pérignon?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about serving temperature for Dom Pérignon. While I have information about chilled presentation and ice service, I don't have specific temperature details in the system prompt. This goes beyond the provided information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for asking about serving temperature. Checking available options.

user:
No worries, I'm sure your staff knows the proper temperature. Can you confirm the total cost for everything?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about total cost. I can calculate this based on the Dom Pérignon price ($450) and mention that romantic setup details would need to be confirmed for pricing.

assistant channel=final:
The Dom Pérignon Vintage 2015 is $450 per bottle. The romantic setup with rose petals, candle lighting, and chocolate truffles would be additional - I'd need to confirm the exact pricing for those special arrangements. The champagne service itself includes chilled presentation, crystal stemware, and professional delivery. Would you like me to arrange everything and provide you with the complete pricing breakdown?

user:
Yes, please go ahead and arrange everything. This is going to be a perfect anniversary celebration!
