Hi there! My wife and I are celebrating our 25th anniversary tonight in the Vineyard Suite. We'd love to have some exceptional wine for our private dinner. What would you recommend?

Congratulations on your 25th anniversary! For such a special milestone, I'd recommend our hotel's exclusive Château Belmont Estate Cabernet 2019 from our own vineyard ($285) - a full-bodied wine with dark fruit and oak aging. For celebration, the Dom Pérignon 2012 ($320) would be perfect for toasting. Both include complimentary decanting and anniversary setup with rose petals.

user:
That sounds absolutely perfect! Can we get both - the Cabernet and the Dom Pérignon? And could you arrange for them to be served with your special anniversary setup?

You know, we had our first date at a little wine bar in San Francisco back in 1999. Time really flies!
