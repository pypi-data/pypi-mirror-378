Perfect! Your GameSphere Pro (CON-99) will be delivered at 7 PM with performance mode enabled and a premium gaming headset. I've also included our gaming optimization guide.

For competitive gaming, here are some room optimization tips:
- **Lighting**: Close blackout curtains and use the room's adjustable lighting for minimal eye strain
- **Temperature**: Set to 68-72°F for optimal focus and comfort
- **Internet**: Your room has dedicated gaming bandwidth - the strongest signal is near the window
- **Ergonomics**: Use the desk chair and position your monitor at eye level
- **Power**: Keep devices plugged in to avoid battery issues during long sessions

Would you like me to arrange any additional accessories or make room adjustments before your session?

user:
The optimization tips are great! Could you also send up a performance monitor and make sure the room temperature is set for gaming?
