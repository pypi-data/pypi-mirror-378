user:
I'd like to request housekeeping for my room. I have my dog with me, just so you know.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user has a pet and is requesting housekeeping. I need to assure them that we use pet-safe cleaning products and do extra cleaning for pet hair. I should also offer them the complimentary pet welcome kit and the "pet sleeping" door hanger.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you for letting us know. We use special pet-safe cleaning products and will take extra care with any pet hair. We also have a complimentary welcome kit for your dog with a water bowl and a toy, and a "pet sleeping" door hanger you can use.

That's amazing! Does the hotel offer a pet-walking service?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about a pet-walking service, which is not in my system prompt. I will use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I am looking into our pet service options for you.

I was so worried about finding a hotel that would be this accommodating.

The user is expressing relief and happiness. I should respond in a friendly and welcoming manner.

We love having furry guests! We want to make sure both you and your dog have a comfortable and happy stay.
