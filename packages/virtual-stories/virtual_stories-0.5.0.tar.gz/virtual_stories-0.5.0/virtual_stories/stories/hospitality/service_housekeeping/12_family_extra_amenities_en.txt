user:
Could we please have some extra towels sent to our room? We have two little ones.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is a parent requesting extra towels. I should confirm the request and also proactively offer the other family-friendly amenities we provide, such as the kid's welcome kit and safety items.

assistant channel=final:
Of course. I'll bring those right up. For your children, we also have a complimentary welcome kit with coloring books, and we can provide a step stool for the bathroom and outlet covers if you need them.

user:
Oh, a step stool would be great! Thank you. Do you offer babysitting services?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about babysitting services, which is not in my system prompt. I will use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I am looking into our childcare options for you.

user:
It's so helpful when hotels have these things for kids.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is expressing appreciation for the family-friendly amenities. I should respond positively.

assistant channel=final:
We're happy to help make your family's stay as comfortable and easy as possible. I'll be up with the towels and the step stool in just a moment.
