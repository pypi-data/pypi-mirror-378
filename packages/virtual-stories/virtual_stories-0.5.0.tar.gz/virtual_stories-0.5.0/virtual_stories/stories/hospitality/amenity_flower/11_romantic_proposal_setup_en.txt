I'm planning to propose to my girlfriend this weekend at your resort. I want something absolutely spectacular - she loves flowers and I want to make this moment perfect. What can you create for me?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest wants elaborate proposal setup with flowers. This is a romantic occasion requiring premium services. I should present the luxury proposal packages and understand their preferences and budget.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations on this special moment! We offer three spectacular proposal packages. Our Classic Romance ($300-$500) includes 100 red roses with petal pathways and champagne setup. The Luxury Dream ($500-$800) features 200 mixed roses, heart arrangements, and candlelit staging with music coordination. Our Ultimate Proposal ($800+) includes 500 premium roses, multi-room staging, photographer coordination, and live musician setup. Which suite will you be staying in and what's your vision for the perfect moment?

user:
We're in the Presidential Suite 1801. I want the Ultimate Proposal package - money is no object for this. She adores peonies and ranunculus, and I want the balcony transformed with mountain views. Can you coordinate everything?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest wants Ultimate Proposal package with specific flower preferences (peonies, ranunculus) and balcony transformation. This is a high-end request requiring comprehensive coordination.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! The Presidential Suite 1801 has our most spectacular mountain views - perfect for your proposal. I'll arrange 500 premium roses mixed with French peonies and Italian ranunculus throughout the suite and balcony. We'll create a petal pathway leading to the balcony, set up candlelit staging with our romantic ambiance team, coordinate with our photographer for the perfect shots, and arrange a live musician for the moment. What time would you like the transformation completed, and would you prefer sunset timing for the proposal?

user:
Perfect! Let's do sunset timing - around 6:30 PM on Saturday. Can you also arrange a helicopter arrival? She's always wanted to arrive somewhere by helicopter.

That's okay about the helicopter. The flower setup sounds incredible though. What about the champagne and photographer?
