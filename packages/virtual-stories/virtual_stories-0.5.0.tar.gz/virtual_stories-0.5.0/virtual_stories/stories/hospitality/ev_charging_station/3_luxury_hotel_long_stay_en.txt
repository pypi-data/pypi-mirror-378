Of course! We have three premium EV charging ports available, and with your two-week stay, you'll receive a 20% discount on charging (effective rate $6.40/hour). Our valet team can handle your charging needs 24/7. Would you prefer a dedicated port reserved for your stay?

user:
That sounds perfect. A dedicated port would be ideal - I have a Tesla Model S. How does the valet service work?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain premium valet charging service and confirm Tesla compatibility.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice! Our Tesla connectors are Level 3 fast-charging capable. Simply pull up to the valet stand, and our team will move your vehicle to the charging port and return it fully charged. We monitor charging progress and can have it ready by your preferred time each day.

user:
Wonderful! Please set that up. I appreciate the premium service.

assistant channel=analysis:
Complete setup and offer additional luxury services.

assistant channel=final:
It's my pleasure to arrange this for you. Your dedicated charging port is now reserved for the duration of your stay. Is there anything else from our concierge services you'd like? Perhaps reservations at our signature restaurant?
