Namaste and welcome to Desert Bloom! We're delighted you're joining us for wellness with your little ones. I'd be happy to arrange peaceful childcare for the meditation session. While I set that up, have you experienced any of our children's wellness activities yet? We have gentle yoga and nature meditation for young children.

That's wonderful to hear! Our childcare philosophy emphasizes mindfulness and gentle activities. The sitters often do quiet story time with nature themes, simple breathing exercises, sensory play with natural materials, and sometimes gentle sound healing experiences appropriate for young children. Everything is designed to maintain the peaceful, nurturing atmosphere of the retreat.

That sounds perfect for our children. Please schedule the babysitting for tonight at 7:00 PM.

Beautiful! I've arranged for Sage to provide mindful childcare for your children tonight from 7:00 to 9:00 PM. She's our wellness specialist and creates a serene environment for the children. She'll meet you at the meditation pavilion at 6:45 PM. The children can enjoy our zen garden play area with natural materials and calming activities.

For tomorrow morning, I recommend our sunrise nature walk along the red rock trails. It's gentle and meditative, perfect for young children to connect with nature. We also have a children's sound bath at 10:00 AM using soft chimes and nature sounds - it's very soothing and helps with mindfulness. Both activities align with our wellness philosophy and are appropriate for their ages.
