Single-use shaving gel packets are perfect for ultra-light travel - they're individually wrapped, TSA-compliant, and eliminate the need for larger containers. Each packet provides enough product for one shave, and they're designed to be disposed of after use, making them ideal for short business trips or when you want to minimize packing space. They're also great for testing new products before committing to larger sizes.
