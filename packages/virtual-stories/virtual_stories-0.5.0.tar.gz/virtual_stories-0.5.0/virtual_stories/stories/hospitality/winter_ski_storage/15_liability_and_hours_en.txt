Hello again! Can you remind me of your opening time tomorrow?

We open at 06:00 and close at 22:00.

If I hand over a camera in my boot bag, is it covered?

assistant channel=analysis:
Valuables should remain with guests; liability limited.

assistant channel=final:
We recommend keeping valuables like cameras with you—our storage is attended, but we don’t cover valuables placed in gear.

user:
Could you extend storage overnight past 22:00 just for us?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; flag.

[ATTENTION] After-hours extension isn't part of our current storage operation. Gathering relevant data.
