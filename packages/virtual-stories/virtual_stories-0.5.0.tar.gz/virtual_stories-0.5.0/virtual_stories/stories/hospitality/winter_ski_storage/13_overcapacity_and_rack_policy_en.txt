Hi there! Cozy carpet in here. We have three boards—can you squeeze one more?

assistant channel=final:
Thanks—glad you like it. Our per‑room limit is two boards/skis with poles and two pairs of boots. We can tag the extra under a second room if available.

user:
Racks look full—can you guarantee space for overnight drying?

assistant channel=analysis:
Racks are first‑come; cannot guarantee.

assistant channel=final:
Overnight racks are first‑come and we can’t guarantee a slot, but we’ll place your gear as soon as space frees up.

user:
Could you install additional racks tonight?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Adding racks overnight isn't something we can implement on the spot. Analyzing the situation.
