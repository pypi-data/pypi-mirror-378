Good evening! If I drop my skis at 21:45, will I still get a claim check?

Yes—you’ll receive a printed claim check linked to your room and name, and it’s mirrored in our system.

We’re on the 08:30 shuttle—can you stage our gear by 08:15?

Within storage hours and before shuttle; yes.

Could you store our drone with the skis for the day?

[ATTENTION] We keep the storage attended, but valuables like drones should stay with you. Researching available details.
