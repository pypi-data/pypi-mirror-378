Hi! Love the sandcastle in the lobby. Do you have rooms with bunk beds—or better yet, connecting rooms?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; present FDX +$25, CKT +$55, safety note, hold until 14:00, kids kit.

assistant channel=final:
The sandcastle is a hit—our team rebuilds it every weekend. We offer Family Deluxe with bunk beds at +$25/night and Connecting King+Twin at +$55/night. We hold unassigned connecting rooms for families until 14:00. Top bunks are recommended for ages 6 and up, and we’ll add guard rails. Your kids also get a welcome kit at check-in.

user:
Can we switch mid-stay if connecting opens up tomorrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide guidance to revisit inventory.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we can reassess inventory tomorrow at midday and help you move if a connecting set becomes available.

user:
Could you reconfigure furniture in another occupied room right now to make a connecting pair?

assistant channel=analysis:
Out of scope; end with flag.
