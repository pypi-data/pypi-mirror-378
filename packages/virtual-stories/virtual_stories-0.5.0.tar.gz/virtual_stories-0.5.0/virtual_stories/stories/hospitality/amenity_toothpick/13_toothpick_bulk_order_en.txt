The branded packaging sounds great! What flavors would you recommend for a corporate reception?

For a corporate reception, I'd recommend our mint-infused or citrus blend toothpicks - they're refreshing and professional. The eucalyptus option is also popular for its clean, sophisticated taste that works well in business settings.

The Art Deco Historic District must be fascinating to explore.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is small talk about local attractions, which I can acknowledge based on the system information about the Art Deco Historic District being a UNESCO World Heritage site.

assistant channel=final:
The Art Deco Historic District is incredible! As a UNESCO World Heritage site, it offers stunning architecture and fascinating history just a short walk from our location.

Could you also provide custom toothpicks with our company logo engraved?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about custom engraved toothpicks with company logos, which goes beyond our standard branded packaging. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since custom engraving services aren't covered in our system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you'd like custom engraved toothpicks with your company logo. Reviewing available resources.
