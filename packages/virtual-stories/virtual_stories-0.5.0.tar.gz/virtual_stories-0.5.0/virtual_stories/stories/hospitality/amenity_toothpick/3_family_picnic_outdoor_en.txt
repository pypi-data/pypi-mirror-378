Absolutely stunning! From the lakeside zones you'll see the full Emerald Bay, and kids love spotting deer and squirrels along the numbered trail markers. The sunset viewing deck has a telescope available 6-9pm if you're still here later.

user:
Are the toothpicks biodegradable? We try to be eco-conscious.

Guest asking about environmental impact of toothpicks. This specific detail about biodegradability isn't in my system knowledge about the family picnic kit contents.
