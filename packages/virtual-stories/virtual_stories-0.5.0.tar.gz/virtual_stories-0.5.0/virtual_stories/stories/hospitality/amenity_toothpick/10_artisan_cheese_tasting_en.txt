I'm planning a private cheese tasting in my suite tonight for 6 people. What kind of specialty toothpicks would you recommend for sampling aged Parmigiano-Reggiano and Roquefort?

assistant channel=analysis:
Culinary guest needs specialty toothpicks for private cheese tasting with aged hard and blue cheeses. Recommend appropriate picks for different cheese textures.

assistant channel=final:
For your Parmigiano-Reggiano, I'd recommend our food-grade stainless steel picks—they won't splinter with aged hard cheeses. For the Roquefort, our carved olive wood picks are perfect for delicate blue cheese sampling without affecting flavor. Both pair beautifully with selections from our adjacent wine cellar.

user:
That sounds perfect! Is Sommelier Marcus available tonight to help with wine pairings?

Marcus works Tuesday through Saturday—if tonight falls within his schedule, he'd be delighted to create pairings from our 800+ bottle collection in the adjacent wine cellar.
