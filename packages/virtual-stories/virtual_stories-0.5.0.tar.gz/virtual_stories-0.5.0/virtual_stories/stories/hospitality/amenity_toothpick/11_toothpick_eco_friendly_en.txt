I'm very environmentally conscious. Do you have any eco-friendly toothpick alternatives to the wooden ones?

The guest is asking about eco-friendly toothpick alternatives. I can provide information about our bamboo toothpicks, biodegradable materials, and sustainability commitment.

Absolutely! We offer bamboo toothpicks made from biodegradable materials as part of our sustainability commitment. We also have compostable packaging and participate in zero-waste initiatives throughout the property.

Could you provide toothpicks made from recycled ocean plastic?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about toothpicks made from recycled ocean plastic, which goes beyond our current eco-friendly options. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since ocean plastic toothpicks aren't covered in our system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you'd like toothpicks made from recycled ocean plastic. Reviewing available resources.
