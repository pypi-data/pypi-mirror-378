Could we do a day‑use until 17:45 in our suite?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use day‑use window and housekeeping sync.

assistant channel=final:
We can request a day‑use hold until 17:45 at the day‑use rate, contingent on arrival assignments. Housekeeping needs a turnover sync—linen staging starts around 12:30, and we’ll coordinate the schedule.

Will our digital keys keep working?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain key policy.

assistant channel=final:
Once approved, we’ll extend your digital keys to match the confirmed time so you won’t lose access mid‑day.
