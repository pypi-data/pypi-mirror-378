I have a 12:15 clinic appointment next door. Could I check out at 13:45?

Use medical consideration and fee windows.

assistant channel=final:
We’ll prioritize your request with your appointment confirmation. A 13:45 departure falls in the half‑day fee window (12:00–14:00). If mobility is a factor, we can place you near the elevators.

Can I email the appointment confirmation?

assistant channel=analysis:
Accept proof and process.

assistant channel=final:
Yes, you can email it and we’ll attach it to your reservation notes and process the extension.
