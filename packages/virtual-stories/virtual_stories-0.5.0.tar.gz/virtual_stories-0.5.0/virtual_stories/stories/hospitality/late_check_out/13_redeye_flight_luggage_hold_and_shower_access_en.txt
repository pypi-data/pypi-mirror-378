Our flight leaves at 23:40. Can we keep the room until 19:00?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use late check‑out subject to availability and potential fee; offer alternatives.

assistant channel=final:
We can request a 19:00 check‑out; if available, it would fall into an extended late check‑out fee. As an alternative, we can store your bags until 22:00 and extend access to the fitness center showers until 21:00.

user:
If we store bags, can we shower at 20:30?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm fitness center showers until 21:00.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—fitness center showers are available for registered guests until 21:00, so 20:30 works.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you—sunset is a favorite time here.

user:
Are airlines coordinating with hotels to extend luggage hold up to midnight this weekend?
