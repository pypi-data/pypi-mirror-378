Hi there! What a gorgeous day - perfect for our wedding that just finished yesterday! I'm the maid of honor and I'm trying to coordinate transportation to the airport for our wedding party. It's... well, it's a bit of a logistical nightmare, honestly.

assistant channel=analysis:
A wedding party just finished and the maid of honor needs help coordinating airport transportation for multiple people. This sounds complex and might require detailed group scheduling that I don't have tools for. I should be friendly and ask for specifics while acknowledging the beautiful day.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations on the wedding! It really is a perfect day here at Coastal Elegance - I hope the ceremony was as beautiful as this weather. I'd love to help with the airport coordination. Tell me about this logistical challenge you're facing!

user:
Thank you! The ceremony was magical on your beach pavilion. So here's the situation: we have 14 people in the wedding party, plus family members - about 22 people total. But everyone has different flights! Some leave this morning, some tonight, some tomorrow. A few are going to LAX instead of Santa Barbara Airport. The bride's grandmother needs wheelchair assistance, and the groomsmen want to stop at a specific restaurant on the way. Can you help coordinate all of this?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is an extremely complex group coordination request involving:
- 22 people with different departure times
- Multiple destinations (SBA and LAX)
- Wheelchair accessibility needs
- Special stops at restaurants
- Varying schedules across multiple days

Our standard shuttle runs only 3 times daily to SBA only. I don't have access to group coordination systems, custom scheduling tools, or the ability to arrange special routing with restaurant stops. This requires specialized group transportation coordination that goes beyond what I can handle.

assistant channel=final:
What a wonderful celebration it must have been! I can definitely understand why this feels like a logistical challenge - 22 people with different flights, multiple airports, and special needs is quite complex.

Our standard shuttle service runs three times daily to Santa Barbara Airport, but what you're describing with the multiple destinations, varying schedules, wheelchair assistance, and restaurant stops requires much more specialized coordination than our regular service can handle.

user:
Oh, I was really hoping you could help us figure this out. We're all staying here for another day or two, but people are starting to stress about getting to their flights. Do you have any contacts with private transportation companies that handle large groups?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about private transportation companies for large group coordination. While hotels often have relationships with various service providers, I don't have access to detailed vendor databases, pricing information, or the ability to coordinate complex multi-destination group transportation bookings.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I completely understand the stress - after such a wonderful celebration, the last thing anyone wants is transportation worries. While we work with various transportation providers, coordinating something this complex with multiple destinations, special needs, and custom routing requires specialized arrangements.

user:
Okay, I appreciate that you're looking into it. How long do you think it might take? Some people are getting pretty anxious about their flight arrangements.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for a timeline, but I don't have the ability to coordinate complex group transportation or access to the systems needed to provide accurate timelines for such arrangements. I should acknowledge their urgency while maintaining the flag response.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I absolutely understand the urgency and anxiety - wedding parties deserve to end on a stress-free note! The complexity of coordinating 22 people across multiple airports with special requirements means this needs proper attention. This is being processed as a priority given the time-sensitive nature.
