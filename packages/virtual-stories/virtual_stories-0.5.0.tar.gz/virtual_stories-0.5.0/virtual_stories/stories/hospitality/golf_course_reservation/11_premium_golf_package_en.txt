That sounds absolutely incredible! What's the pricing for this premium package?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about pricing for the premium package. However, I notice that my system prompt only contains individual service pricing (golf rates, cart rental, equipment rental, spa treatments, restaurant pricing) but doesn't specify the total package price. This would be a case where I need to use the [ATTENTION] flag since the specific package pricing isn't provided in my system context.

[ATTENTION] I'm looking into the current pricing for our Premium Golf Experience Package.

user:
I see. Well, let me ask about something else - what's the course like? I'm a pretty serious golfer and I want to make sure it's challenging enough.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the course characteristics and difficulty level. I have detailed information about the course in my system prompt, including the grass types, water hazards, course rating, slope rating, and average round time. This information is available in my system context.

assistant channel=final:
Our championship course is definitely designed to challenge serious golfers! It features Bermuda grass fairways and bentgrass greens, with challenging water hazards strategically placed on holes 3, 7, and 15. The course has a rating of 72.1 and a slope rating of 134, which indicates it's quite challenging for most players.

The course was designed by Jack Nicklaus, so you can expect strategic bunkering, undulating greens, and risk-reward opportunities throughout your round. The average round time is about 4.5 hours, and we maintain a dress code requiring collared shirts, golf shorts or slacks, and soft spikes.

user:
Perfect! That sounds like exactly what I'm looking for. One more question - do you have any special events or tournaments coming up during my stay?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about special events or tournaments. My system prompt contains information about the golf course operations, rates, and amenities, but doesn't include any information about upcoming tournaments, special events, or scheduled competitions. This would be beyond my system context, so I should use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Checking available options for upcoming golf events and tournaments.
