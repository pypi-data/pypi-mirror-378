Hi there! My 16-year-old daughter has never played golf before, but she's really interested in learning. Do you offer lessons for complete beginners?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about golf lessons for a beginner teenager. I have comprehensive information about our golf instruction services in my system prompt, including beginner group lessons, private instruction, junior programs, and pricing. I should provide details about the available options for beginners.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We have excellent programs for beginners, and your daughter is at a perfect age to start learning golf. We offer both private one-on-one instruction and beginner group lessons that are ideal for newcomers to the sport.

For complete beginners, I'd recommend starting with our beginner group lessons, which cover basic swing mechanics, putting fundamentals, and course etiquette. These lessons have a maximum of 6 students, so your daughter will get personalized attention while learning alongside other beginners.

We also have private instruction available with our PGA-certified professional instructors, which can be tailored specifically to her learning pace and skill level. Our instructors are experienced with teaching teenagers and use age-appropriate methods.

That sounds great! What about equipment? She doesn't have any golf clubs yet.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about equipment rental for their daughter. I have detailed information about equipment rental options in my system prompt, including specific pricing for teen clubs and what's included in the rental sets.

assistant channel=final:
No problem at all! We have teen clubs available for rent at $20 per day for ages 13-17, which would be perfect for your daughter. The rental set includes a golf bag, tees, and ball markers. We also have golf balls available for purchase at $5 per sleeve.

Our rental equipment is well-maintained and appropriate for beginners, so she won't need to invest in clubs right away. This gives her a chance to see if she enjoys the sport before making any equipment purchases.

user:
Perfect! What are your lesson rates? I'm thinking we might do a few lessons during our stay.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about lesson pricing. I have detailed pricing information in my system prompt for both private and group lessons, including junior rates and package discounts.

assistant channel=final:
For your daughter's age group, our junior rates are: Private instruction is $90 per hour or $200 for a 2-hour session, and group lessons are $35 per person per hour. Since she's a beginner, I'd suggest starting with a few group lessons to learn the basics, then perhaps a private lesson to focus on specific areas.

If you're planning to book multiple lessons, we offer custom packages with a 10% discount for 5 or more lesson bookings. We also have short game clinics for $60 per person that focus on chipping, pitching, and bunker play techniques.

That's very reasonable! Do you have any special programs or events for young golfers?

My system prompt contains information about junior golf programs and instruction services, but doesn't include specific details about special events, tournaments, or seasonal programs for young golfers. This would be beyond my system context, so I should use the [ATTENTION] flag.

Thanks! One more question - what's your practice facility like? I want to make sure she'll have a good place to practice.

Our practice facility is excellent for beginners! We have a 300-yard driving range with 25 covered hitting bays, so she can practice her swing comfortably even in different weather conditions. There's also a short game area with a chipping green and sand bunker for practicing those tricky shots around the green.

The putting green has multiple pin positions with various slope conditions, which is perfect for learning distance control and reading greens. We also have a covered teaching area with mirrors and training aids that our instructors use during lessons.
