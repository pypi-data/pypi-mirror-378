Hi there—do you do twilight rates? We’re thinking a relaxed couples round near sunset tomorrow. Our reservation is RSV22001.

Yes—twilight starts at 3:00 PM with $79 per player and a shared cart included. Our sunsets over the dunes are gorgeous from the back nine. Would 3:40 PM tomorrow work for your couples round?
