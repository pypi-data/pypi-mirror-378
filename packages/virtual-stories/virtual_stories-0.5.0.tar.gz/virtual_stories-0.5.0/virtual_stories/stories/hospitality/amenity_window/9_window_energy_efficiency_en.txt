user:
Hi! I'm really impressed with the environmental focus of this resort. I noticed the windows seem to change tint automatically. Can you tell me more about the energy-efficient features?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is interested in our environmental features and energy-efficient windows. This aligns perfectly with our sustainability mission. I should explain our green technologies and check their room's energy metrics.

assistant channel=final:
I'm delighted you're interested in our environmental initiatives! GreenHorizon Resort is LEED Platinum certified with cutting-edge green technologies. What is your room number so I can show you the specific energy metrics and features?

user:
I'm in room 1224. The views of the red rocks are stunning, and I love that it's all sustainable!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is in room 1224 and appreciates our sustainability. I should check their energy metrics and demonstrate our green features.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.check_energy_metrics:
{"room_number": "1224", "metric_type": "daily_usage"}

tool.check_energy_metrics channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"daily_savings": "35%", "carbon_offset": "12kg", "efficiency_rating": "A+", "renewable_percentage": "85%"}

assistant channel=analysis:
The room shows excellent energy metrics. I should explain our window technologies and offer to optimize the settings.

assistant channel=final:
Your room 1224 is performing excellently with 35% daily energy savings and 85% renewable energy usage! Our windows feature:
- Triple-pane Low-E glass for superior insulation
- Dynamic electrochromic tinting that adjusts to sunlight
- Argon gas filling for better thermal performance
- UV protection to reduce cooling needs

user:
That's amazing! How does the dynamic tinting work exactly?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about our dynamic tinting technology, which is detailed information I have in my system prompt. I can explain this without needing tools.

assistant channel=final:
Our dynamic tinting is revolutionary:
- Electrochromic technology changes glass opacity electronically
- Automatically tints darker during bright sunlight to reduce heat gain
- Lightens during cloudy conditions to maximize natural light
- Can be manually controlled or set to automatic optimization
- Reduces HVAC energy use by up to 30%
- Maintains optimal indoor comfort year-round

user:
Incredible! Sedona's desert climate must really benefit from this. Speaking of which, what's the best time for stargazing here?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about stargazing in Sedona. This doesn't require specific information from my system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Sedona's clear skies are perfect for stargazing! I don't have specific timing recommendations since I focus on our resort's sustainability, but many guests enjoy the evening views from our property.

user:
By the way, I was curious about the history of sustainable hotel practices and how GreenHorizon became a leader in this area.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the history of sustainable hotel practices, which is detailed historical information not available in my basic system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research the history of sustainable hospitality practices.

assistant channel=analysis:
I should offer alternative assistance while the information is being gathered.

assistant channel=final:
While I look into that, I can tell you that GreenHorizon has been a sustainability leader since our founding in 2010. If you'd like, I can provide information about our current green certifications or arrange a sustainability tour of the property.
