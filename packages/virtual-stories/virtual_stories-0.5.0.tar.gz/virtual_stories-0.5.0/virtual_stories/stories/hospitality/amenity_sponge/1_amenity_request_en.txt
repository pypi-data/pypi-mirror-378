user:
Hi, I seem to have made a small spill. Could I get a sponge to clean it up?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is requesting a sponge. I should use the `request_amenity` tool to fulfill this request. I will request one sponge.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "sponge", "quantity": 1}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A sponge has been dispatched to your room. It should arrive in 5-10 minutes."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I should now inform the user that the sponge is on its way.

assistant channel=final:
Of course. I've requested a sponge for you. It will be delivered to your room in about 5-10 minutes. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

user:
No, that's all. Thanks for your help! By the way, I love the view from my room.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is making small talk. I should respond politely.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! I'm glad you're enjoying the view. We pride ourselves on our stunning cityscapes. Enjoy the rest of your stay!

user:
I have another question, can I get a ticket for the museum?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for a museum ticket. I do not have a tool to book museum tickets. I should use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's an interesting question. I'm looking into this.
