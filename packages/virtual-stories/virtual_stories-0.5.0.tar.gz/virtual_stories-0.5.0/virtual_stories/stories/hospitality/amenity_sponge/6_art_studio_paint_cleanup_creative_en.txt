Hi! I'm working on a watercolor series in the Monet Studio and need some sponges for paint cleanup. The natural light here is incredible!

assistant channel=final:
Wonderful! The Monet Studio has amazing light for watercolors. I can provide natural sea wool sponges perfect for watercolor work - they have controlled moisture absorption and are gentle on brush bristles. Would you like lint-free microfiber ones too for detail work?

user:
Yes, both types would be great! I'm working on a series of Bay Area landscapes and need precision for the fine details.

Perfect! I'm sending a watercolor precision set to the Monet Studio within 15 minutes - 3 natural sea wool sponges and 2 lint-free microfiber ones, plus an artist care guide. Bay Area landscapes are stunning subjects for watercolor work!
