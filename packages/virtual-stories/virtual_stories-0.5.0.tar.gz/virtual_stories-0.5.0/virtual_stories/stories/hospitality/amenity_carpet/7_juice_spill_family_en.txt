Hi—tiny orange juice spill in room 321. Will it stain if we wait? Can you schedule someone?

assistant channel=analysis:
Reassure using system; provide standard/expe windows; then create ticket.

assistant channel=final:
Juice is usually handled with a water blot and, if needed, a low oxidizer—waiting a short time is okay. I can place you in the 25–45 minute window or expedite at 10–18 minutes. Which do you prefer for room 321?

user:
Standard is fine.

Do you have babysitting services on-site?

[ATTENTION] I’ll check on babysitting options beyond our carpet services.
