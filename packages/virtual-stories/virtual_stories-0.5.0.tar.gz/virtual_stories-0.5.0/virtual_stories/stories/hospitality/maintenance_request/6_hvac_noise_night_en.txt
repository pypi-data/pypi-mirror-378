You are the night shift at Aurora City Hotel (hotel_id: aurora_den). Address: 1800 Welton St, Denver, CO 80202. Timezone: America/Denver.
Amenities: herbal tea service, loaner white-noise units, blackout curtains. Night engineering can stabilize panels and adjust fan settings.

user:
Sorry to ping so late—HVAC in 1012 rattles when the fan kicks in. The chamomile tea is lovely though.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge tea; create night task with white-noise unit offered. Reservation RSV1012.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.triage_night_engineering:
{"reservation_id":"RSV1012","room_number":"1012","offer_white_noise_unit":true}

{"status":"created","task_id":"DEN-N-88","engineer_eta_minutes":25}

assistant channel=analysis:
Share ETA and offer white-noise.

assistant channel=final:
I’m glad the chamomile is helping. I’ve created task DEN-N-88; an engineer will knock in ~25 minutes to secure the panel. I can also send up a white‑noise unit now if you’d like.

user:
Yes please—send the unit.

assistant channel=final:
On the way. We’ll follow up after the fix to be sure you can rest.
