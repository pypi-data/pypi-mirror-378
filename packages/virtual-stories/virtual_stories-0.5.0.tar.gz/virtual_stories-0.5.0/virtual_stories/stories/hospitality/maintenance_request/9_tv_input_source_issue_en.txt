Hi—my TV in 221 is stuck on HDMI and won’t go back to channels. The sunrise coffee was great!

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge compliment; schedule A/V reset priority medium. Reservation RSV0221.

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide ETA and quick DIY step.

assistant channel=final:
Glad you caught the sunrise pour. I’ve scheduled ticket AV-77 with a 40‑minute ETA to reset the TV and pair the remote. If you’d like, try holding the “Input” button for 5 seconds—sometimes it frees up the menu.

user:
I’ll try that—thanks.

assistant channel=final:
We’ll see you shortly and make sure live TV is restored.
