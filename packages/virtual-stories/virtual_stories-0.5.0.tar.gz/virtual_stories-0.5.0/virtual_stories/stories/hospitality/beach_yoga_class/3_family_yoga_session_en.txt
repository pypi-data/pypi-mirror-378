Wonderful choice! The 8:00 AM family session is perfect for bonding time. Our instructor specializes in making yoga accessible and fun for children. Your daughter won't need any special equipment—we provide kid-sized mats, colorful blocks, and even some Hawaiian cultural movements to make it engaging. The session lasts about 45 minutes and ends with a family group photo by the palm trees.

Mahalo for setting that up! Our daughter is going to be so excited. By the way, what's the best snorkeling spot near the resort for after our yoga session?

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual conversation about local activities - provide general information based on resort knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! Right after yoga, I recommend our family snorkeling area at Hanauma Bay—it's just a 10-minute shuttle ride and perfect for all ages. The coral gardens are amazing, and we can arrange gear rental if needed. Enjoy your Hawaiian adventure!
