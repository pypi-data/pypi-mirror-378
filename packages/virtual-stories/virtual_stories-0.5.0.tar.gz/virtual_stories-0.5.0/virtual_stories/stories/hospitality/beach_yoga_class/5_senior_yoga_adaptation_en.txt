The 9 AM gentle adaptive session sounds just right for me. I'm Margaret Thompson. I have some knee issues, so I might need extra support. Can you help me with that?

You're very welcome! The desert views are most stunning during our morning sessions when the light hits the mountains just right. You'll see the saguaro silhouettes and golden hues that make Scottsdale so special. Enjoy your practice and the beautiful scenery!
