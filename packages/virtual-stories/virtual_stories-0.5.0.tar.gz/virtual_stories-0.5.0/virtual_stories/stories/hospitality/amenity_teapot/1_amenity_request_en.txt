user:
I would like to brew some tea in my room. Could you please provide me with a teapot?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is requesting a teapot. I will use the `request_amenity` tool to fulfill this request.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "teapot", "quantity": 1}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A teapot will be delivered to your room shortly."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I will inform the user that the teapot is on its way.

assistant channel=final:
But of course. I have arranged for a fine porcelain teapot to be sent to your room. It will be there in a few minutes. We hope you enjoy your tea.

user:
Thank you. The afternoon tea in the lobby was exquisite yesterday.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is complimenting the hotel's afternoon tea. I should respond graciously.

assistant channel=final:
We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed it. Our pastry chef takes great pride in creating a memorable experience. We hope you will join us again.

user:
I would like to make a reservation for the afternoon tea for two people tomorrow.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user wants to make a reservation for afternoon tea. I do not have a tool for that. I will use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I can certainly assist you with that. Checking available options.
