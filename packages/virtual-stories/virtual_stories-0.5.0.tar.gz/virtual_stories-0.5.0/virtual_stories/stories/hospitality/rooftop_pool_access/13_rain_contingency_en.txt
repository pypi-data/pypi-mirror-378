Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Rooftop Pool closes for lightning or severe wind; light rain may keep deck open at staff discretion. Towels available; please avoid running on wet surfaces. Acrylic drinkware only.

user:
If it drizzles later, will the rooftop stay open?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain policy succinctly.

assistant channel=final:
In light rain, the deck often remains open at the attendants’ discretion, but we close immediately for lightning or severe winds. We’ll keep towels stocked—just be cautious on the wet surface.

user:
Could you text me the moment it reopens if it closes?

assistant channel=analysis:
Proactive texting beyond context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Thanks for the heads-up—retrieving information on notification options.
