system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Rooftop Pool hours 07:00–21:00. Peak sunset times see higher traffic; attendants manage in/out flow at elevator landing. Towels at Rooftop Towel Stand; keep walkways clear for photo takers.

user:
Is there a cap on the number of people at sunset, and how long is the wait?

assistant channel=analysis:
Describe managed flow without stating numbers; advise etiquette.

assistant channel=final:
Sunset does draw a crowd. Our attendants manage a simple in/out flow at the rooftop elevator landing so it stays comfortable up there. Towels are at the stand, and if you’re snapping photos, stepping to the side keeps sightlines open for everyone.

user:
Could you hold spots for us at 18:45?

assistant channel=analysis:
Holding spots beyond context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I see the timing—investigating potential answers with the team.
