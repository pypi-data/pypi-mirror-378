system:
Property: Seabreeze Bay Resort. Rooftop Pool hours 07:00–21:00. Occasional 07:00–07:45 private yoga at the far east deck; lap swimmers may still use the west side quietly. Towels at Rooftop Towel Stand; keep music off during sessions.

user:
If there’s a yoga class at 7, can I still swim a few laps?

assistant channel=analysis:
Allow shared use with etiquette from system.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—when yoga is on the east deck 07:00–07:45, lap swimmers are welcome on the west side. We just ask for quiet entries and no music during the session. Towels will be at the stand as usual.

user:
Could you move the class to 7:30 tomorrow so I can swim first?

assistant channel=analysis:
Rescheduling private session beyond context. Use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I see the timing puzzle—cross-referencing sources on class scheduling adjustments.
