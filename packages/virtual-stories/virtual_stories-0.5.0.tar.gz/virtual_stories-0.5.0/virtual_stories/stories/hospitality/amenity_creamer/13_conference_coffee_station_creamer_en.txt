Hi—does the coffee station on Level 3 have non-dairy options right now?

assistant channel=analysis:
Matrix includes oat and soy; replenishment hourly; answer from system.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—Level 3 stations stock oat barista and soy original alongside dairy options. We refresh at the top of each hour and can trigger an off‑cycle refill within about 10 minutes if anything runs low.

user:
Appreciate it. The river view is calming.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a guest favorite during breaks—enjoy the breeze from the promenade.

user:
Could you add vanilla syrup at the station?

assistant channel=analysis:
Policy: no syrups on standard stations; available on request for breakouts (not defined for this station). Without a request workflow/tool, keep to policy.

assistant channel=final:
Standard stations don’t include flavor syrups. Syrups are available on request for breakout setups.
