Absolutely! We have excellent accessible options. We have 2 adaptive bikes with low step-through frames and enhanced braking systems, plus 1 hand cycle for upper body power. All include stabilizer wheels for extra balance support (EUR 3/day). We also have a tandem bike if you'd prefer assisted riding. What type of mobility support would work best for you?

user:
The adaptive bike with stabilizer wheels sounds perfect! What routes would be most suitable for someone with mobility considerations?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about suitable routes for mobility considerations. This information is available in my system context about accessibility routes, so I can provide this directly.

assistant channel=final:
Great choice! For mobility considerations, I recommend the flat waterfront promenade - it's completely wheelchair accessible with smooth surfaces and beautiful sea views. The Montjuïc accessible route has gentle slopes and is very manageable. The Gothic Quarter is mostly flat but has some cobblestones to be aware of. All routes have emergency contact devices and we can provide personal assistance for EUR 15/hour if needed.

user:
That's very reassuring! Can you tell me about the hotel's accessibility features beyond just the bikes?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about the hotel's general accessibility features beyond bikes. This information is available in my system context about hotel accessibility, so I can provide this directly.

assistant channel=final:
Of course! Our hotel is fully wheelchair accessible throughout, including all 20 floors via elevator. We have accessible parking spaces, and our Concierge desk is at an accessible height. The Front Desk operates 24/7 and our Concierge is available 8:00-22:00 for any assistance you might need. All our facilities, including the bike rental area, are designed with accessibility in mind.
