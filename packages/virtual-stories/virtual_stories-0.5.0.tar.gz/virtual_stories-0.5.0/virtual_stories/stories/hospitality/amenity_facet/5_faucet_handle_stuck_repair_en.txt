Hello! I'm in room 312 and the bathroom faucet handle is completely stuck. I can't turn it at all to get any water. It's been like this since I arrived. Can you help?

Guest reporting completely stuck faucet handle in room 312. Need to assess mechanism issue and determine repair approach. Coastal environment may involve corrosion or mineral deposits.

Stuck due to saltwater corrosion and mineral deposits from coastal well water. Single lever mechanism needs full replacement. Our Cape Cod location requires corrosion-resistant components.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect! I've completely replaced the stuck handle in room 312 with a corrosion-resistant assembly. The saltwater air in Provincetown can cause these issues, but our new components are specifically designed for coastal environments with protective coatings.

user:
That's amazing! The handle turns so smoothly now. You can tell this place has been around for a while with all the character.

Speaking of that history, I heard this area has some amazing lighthouses. Do you know of any good lighthouse tours or boat excursions?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest asking about local lighthouse tours and boat excursions. This is beyond my plumbing and fixture repair knowledge scope. Need to flag for attention and refer to tourism information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Excellent question about Cape Cod's famous lighthouses and boat excursions. Checking available tour information.

That's okay, I'll ask at the front desk. Thanks so much for the quick handle repair!
