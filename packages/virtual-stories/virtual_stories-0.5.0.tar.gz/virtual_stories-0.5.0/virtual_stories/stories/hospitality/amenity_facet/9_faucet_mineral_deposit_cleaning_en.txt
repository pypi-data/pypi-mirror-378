Hello! I'm in room 789 and the bathroom sink faucet has a lot of white mineral deposits built up. The water flow is getting weaker and it looks really unsightly. Can you clean this up?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest reporting mineral deposits in room 789 bathroom sink faucet. Need to inspect deposit accumulation and determine appropriate descaling method. Texas Hill Country well water is naturally hard with high mineral content.
