Wonderful choice! The biodegradable paper bags with seed-embedded handles are one of our most popular eco-friendly options. You can plant the handles after use and they'll grow into native Costa Rican plants. I'll arrange 3 bags for room 415 - they'll be delivered within 20 minutes. These bags decompose within 90 days and support our zero-waste policy.
