Portal: https://login.auroradunes.example/guest

Hardware: Cisco Meraki MR46 APs; each floor has 4 APs (B‑12A..B‑12D)

Tip: Disable private MAC on iOS/Android if portal loops

user:
Hi, my Wi‑Fi is super slow in room 1224. Can you help?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm device, MAC, SSID; check AP load; then decide reset or 2.4/5 GHz.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely—happy to help. Which device is affected, which SSID are you on (Aurora_Guest_5G or 2G), and could you share the device MAC address (Settings → About)?

user:
It's my MacBook on Aurora_Guest_5G. MAC is 3C:15:C2:9A:7E:11.

AP is crowded; perform refresh and consider temporary whitelist to bypass portal.

{"room_number":"1224","device_mac":"3C:15:C2:9A:7E:11","reason":"High AP load; refresh DHCP/portal lease"}

assistant channel=final:
Thanks—I refreshed your lease. Please toggle Wi‑Fi off/on and rejoin Aurora_Guest_5G. If speeds are still poor, we can whitelist your Mac for 7 days so it skips the portal. Want me to do that?

user:
Yes please. Also, what time is breakfast?

assistant channel=analysis:
Proceed with whitelist; answer breakfast from system info; add a small friendly note.

assistant channel=final:
All set—your Mac is whitelisted through next week. Breakfast runs 6:30–10:30 at Seabreeze Café in the lobby. If you need anything else, dial extension 77.
