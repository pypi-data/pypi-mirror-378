We’re in Orion A and Wi‑Fi keeps dropping for attendees.

Run scan; if high 2.4 GHz interference, steer clients to 5 GHz.

assistant channel=final:
I adjusted the network to favor 5 GHz on Skyline_Event. Please have attendees rejoin—stability should improve. The prefunction area is adjacent if anyone needs a quick break space.
