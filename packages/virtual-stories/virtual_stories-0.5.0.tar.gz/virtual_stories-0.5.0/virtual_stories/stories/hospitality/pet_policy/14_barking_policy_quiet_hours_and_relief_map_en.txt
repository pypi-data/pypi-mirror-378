Hi! Night shift must be peaceful—mostly. My puppy gets barky at 1 AM. Any tips and where’s the nearest relief spot?

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk; provide relief map, quiet hours, amenities.

assistant channel=final:
You’re right—it’s calm until the coffee wears off. For relief, use the west exit; there’s a pocket park about 100 meters away with waste bags at the stand. Quiet hours are 22:00–07:00; we can also send a white‑noise machine to help.

user:
What happens if he barks longer than 10 minutes?

assistant channel=analysis:
Courtesy call policy and relocation on second incident.

assistant channel=final:
We’ll place a friendly courtesy call if barking continues past 10 minutes. On a second incident, we can offer a quieter corner room if available.

user:
Can you certify my dog’s behavior score for my landlord tomorrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond scope; special flag.

[ATTENTION] I see the need for documentation. Checking available options.
