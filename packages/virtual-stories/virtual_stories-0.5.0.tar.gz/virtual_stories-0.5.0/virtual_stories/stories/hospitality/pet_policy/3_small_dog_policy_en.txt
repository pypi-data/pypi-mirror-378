Do you allow small dogs?

Confirm size limit and fees; mention pet-friendly floors.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—we welcome dogs up to 35 lbs. There’s a $35 nightly pet fee, and we place pet stays on floors 3–4 near stair x05 for easy outdoor access. Will that work for you?

user:
That’s fine. I’ve got one 22-pound terrier.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge; outline relief zone and housekeeping rule.

assistant channel=final:
Great—there’s a designated relief zone behind the hotel. For housekeeping, your pup should be out of the room or crated; we can schedule service around your plans.

user:
Thanks. And no pets in the restaurant, right?

assistant channel=analysis:
Restate policy.

assistant channel=final:
Correct—no pets in the restaurant or pool area. Patio seating is fine when weather permits.

user:
Appreciate it—she’s friendly.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
She sounds lovely. I’ll assign a floor-3 pet room near stair x05 and note your terrier.
