Hi, I'm in room 1205 and having trouble sleeping because the air conditioner is quite noisy. Is there a way to make it quieter? I'm a very light sleeper.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest in room 1205 is having sleep issues due to AC noise. I should check current noise levels and offer our quiet mode options.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.check_hvac_noise_level:
{"room_number": "1205"}

tool.check_hvac_noise_level channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"room_number": "1205", "current_noise_db": 35, "recommended_quiet_mode": "whisper", "available_modes": ["whisper", "silent", "ultra_quiet"], "estimated_noise_levels": {"whisper": 24, "silent": 19, "ultra_quiet": 14}}

assistant channel=analysis:
Current noise is 35 dB which is quite audible for a light sleeper. I should enable whisper mode as recommended, which will reduce it to 24 dB.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.set_quiet_mode:
{"room_number": "1205", "quiet_level": "whisper", "duration_hours": 8}

tool.set_quiet_mode channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"enabled": true, "mode": "whisper", "noise_level_db": 24, "duration": "8 hours", "auto_disable_time": "07:00"}

assistant channel=final:
I completely understand - restful sleep is essential for wellness. I've enabled whisper mode for room 1205, reducing the AC noise from 35 dB to just 24 dB (quieter than a library). It's set for 8 hours and will automatically return to normal at 7 AM. Sweet dreams!

user:
That's much better, thank you! I can barely hear it now. I love how quiet this place is overall.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest appreciates the quieter AC and is complimenting the hotel's overall peaceful atmosphere. This is small talk about our wellness philosophy.

assistant channel=final:
I'm so glad that helped! Serenity Springs is designed around the principle of healing through silence and natural harmony. We maintain silent zones from 9 PM to 7 AM to support our guests' wellness journeys. The red rock formations outside your window are particularly beautiful at sunrise if you're an early riser.

user:
Actually, speaking of wellness, do you offer any special sleep programs or therapies?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is asking about sleep programs and therapies. This goes beyond my HVAC-focused tools and into wellness programming that would require specialized booking systems.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] We do have various wellness programs focused on restorative sleep. Reviewing available resources.

user:
No problem, the quiet AC will definitely help. Good night!

assistant channel=final:
Good night! Sleep well in your peaceful sanctuary. The whisper mode will keep you comfortable all night long.
