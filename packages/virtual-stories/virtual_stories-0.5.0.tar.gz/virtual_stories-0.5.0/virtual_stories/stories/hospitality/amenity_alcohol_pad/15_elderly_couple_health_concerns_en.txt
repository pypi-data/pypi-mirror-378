Do you have any partnerships with local pharmacies that can deliver prescription medications to the hotel?

assistant channel=analysis:
This question goes beyond our system context. While we mention "Pharmacy delivery service coordination" in our health & wellness services, we don't have specific information about partnerships with local pharmacies for prescription delivery, so I should use the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Reviewing available resources for local pharmacy partnerships.
