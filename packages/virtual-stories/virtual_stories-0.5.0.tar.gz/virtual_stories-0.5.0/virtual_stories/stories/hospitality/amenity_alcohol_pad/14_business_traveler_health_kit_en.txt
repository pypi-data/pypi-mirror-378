Do you have any partnerships with local medical clinics for business travelers who need urgent care?

This question goes beyond our system context. While we mention "Emergency contact cards (urgent care, pharmacies)" in our first-aid supplies, we don't have specific information about partnerships with local medical clinics, so I should use the [ATTENTION] flag.
