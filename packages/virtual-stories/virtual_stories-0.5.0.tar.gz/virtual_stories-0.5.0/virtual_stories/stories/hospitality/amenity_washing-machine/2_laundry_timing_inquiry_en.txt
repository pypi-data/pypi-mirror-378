I'm heading out for a Broadway show tonight but need to do laundry. What are the best times to use the machines without crowds?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants optimal laundry timing. I should check current availability and provide detailed scheduling info based on our peak hours and machine options.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.check_laundry_schedule:
{"time_slot": "7:00 PM", "machine_type": "both"}

tool.check_laundry_schedule channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"available_washers": 5, "available_dryers": 4, "peak_level": "moderate", "express_available": true}

assistant channel=final:
Our laundry room is open 24/7 on B2 level. Peak hours are typically 6-9 PM weekdays. Right now at 7 PM, we have 5 washers and 4 dryers available with moderate activity. The express service (45-minute total) is also available for $5 extra.

user:
That sounds perfect. The express option would work great since I need to leave soon. How does it work?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about express service which is detailed in our system information. I can explain this directly from the available knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
The express service uses our premium machines with faster cycles - wash in 20 minutes, dry in 25 minutes. It's $5 extra per load and includes complimentary detergent pods. You can reserve a machine slot if you'd prefer to guarantee availability.

user:
I'd like to reserve an express washer for 8 PM tonight. How do I do that?

tool.reserve_machine channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"reservation_id": "EXP-2024-001", "confirmation": "Express washer reserved for 8:00 PM", "instructions": "Present reservation ID at laundry room entrance"}

Perfect! I've reserved express washer slot EXP-2024-001 for 8:00 PM tonight. Just show the reservation ID at the laundry room entrance. We also have folding tables, fabric softener sheets, and laundry bags available - all complimentary.

Thanks! By the way, I noticed you have a linen reuse program. How does that work?

assistant channel=analysis:

Our linen reuse program is part of our sustainability initiative. We use eco-friendly detergents and encourage guests to reuse towels and linens during their stay to reduce water and energy consumption. You can opt-in by leaving your towels on the rack rather than on the floor.
