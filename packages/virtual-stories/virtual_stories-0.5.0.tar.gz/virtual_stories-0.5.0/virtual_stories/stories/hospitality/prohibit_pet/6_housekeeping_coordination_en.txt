Yes—that’s fine. I can schedule housekeeping when you’re present; I’ve noted 14:00–15:00 for room 927.

user:
Thanks—the lake view is relaxing.

assistant channel=final:
Glad you’re enjoying it.

user:
Can housekeeping walk the dog if I step out briefly?

assistant channel=analysis:
Staff do not handle animals per guideline. Decline accordingly.

assistant channel=final:
Our staff don’t handle animals, so we can’t walk your dog. We can time service while you’re in the room.
