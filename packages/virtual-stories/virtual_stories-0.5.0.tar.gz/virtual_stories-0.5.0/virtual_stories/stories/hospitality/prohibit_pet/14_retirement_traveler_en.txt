I'm retired and traveling with my small dog. Can I bring them to the hotel?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about bringing a dog, but the system clearly states that no pets are permitted in guestrooms or public areas. I need to explain this policy and offer the partner kennel alternative.

assistant channel=final:
Guestrooms and public areas are pet-free for all guests' comfort. However, our partner Harbor Paws Kennel is just 0.8 km away with climate-controlled suites and 24/7 onsite staff for day-visit and overnight stays.

That sounds perfect! I love the quiet zone in the Central Courtyard.
