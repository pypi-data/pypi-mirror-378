How does the pool towel exchange work? I saw the RFID system mentioned.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about our pool towel exchange service and RFID system, which is covered in my system knowledge about the poolside exchange station and tracking system.

assistant channel=final:
Great question! Our poolside towel exchange station is open 6AM-10PM with unlimited exchanges. The RFID tracking system helps us monitor towel usage, prevent loss, and ensure hygiene standards. Simply bring your used towels to the station and exchange them for fresh ones - it's completely complimentary.

That's really convenient. The ocean-view infinity pool is absolutely stunning.

The ocean-view infinity pool is definitely a highlight! The cabanas provide perfect spots to relax and enjoy the view.

This is small talk about the guest's plans, which I can acknowledge in a friendly way.

Perfect! With unlimited towel exchanges and our poolside bar serving signature margaritas, you'll have everything you need for a relaxing day.

user:
Could you set up a private towel service for my cabana?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about private cabana towel service, which goes beyond our standard pool towel exchange. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since private cabana services aren't covered in our system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you'd like private towel service for your cabana. Checking available options.
