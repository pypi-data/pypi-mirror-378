I'd love to upgrade to the spa towels with aromatherapy. Can you arrange that for my room?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to upgrade to spa-quality towels with aromatherapy service. I can provide information about our premium bamboo fiber blend towels and aromatherapy service.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! I can arrange spa towel upgrade for room 842. Our premium bamboo fiber blend towels are 800 GSM with lavender and eucalyptus aromatherapy service. These are the same luxurious towels we use in our Turkish hammam and steam rooms.

user:
Perfect! I had such a relaxing time in the Turkish hammam yesterday.

The guest is sharing their spa experience, which I can acknowledge based on the system information about our Turkish hammam and steam rooms.

The Turkish hammam is such a peaceful retreat! I'm glad you enjoyed the experience.

user:
The poolside bar makes the best margaritas I've ever had.

assistant channel=analysis:
This is small talk about the dining experience, which I can acknowledge based on the system information about signature margaritas at the poolside bar.

assistant channel=final:
Our poolside bar's signature margaritas are a guest favorite! The fresh tropical flavors really complement the ocean view.

user:
Could you also provide heated towels for my morning routine?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about heated towel service, which goes beyond our standard spa towel upgrade. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since heated towel service isn't covered in our system knowledge.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand you'd like heated towels for your morning routine. Reviewing available resources.
