That's excellent coordination! The grand ballroom is stunning. What's the best time for wedding photos?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest asking about wedding photo timing which is part of our event amenities mentioned in system context. Can provide recommendations for ballroom wedding receptions and optimal photography times.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you! The grand ballroom is most photogenic during golden hour (4-6 PM) when the natural light creates beautiful effects through the windows. We also have professional lighting setups for evening receptions to ensure perfect photo conditions.

That's perfect timing advice. I'm also coordinating the catering. How does the towel service integrate with food service?

assistant channel=final:
Excellent! Our towel service integrates seamlessly with catering through coordinated timing - fresh towels are replenished during meal service changes, and we work directly with your caterer to ensure proper sanitation stations and guest comfort throughout the reception.

user:
Speaking of coordination, can you arrange branded towels for our wedding favors?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest asking about branded wedding favor towels. While we have branded towel options mentioned in our bulk towel program, detailed custom branding design and wedding favor coordination go beyond our basic knowledge and require special events concierge services.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Branded wedding favor towels and custom monogramming for favors are wonderful personalization ideas. Checking design options and coordinating with your wedding planner.
