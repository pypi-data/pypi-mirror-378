user:
I'm curious about your towel specifications. What does 600 GSM mean, and why Egyptian cotton?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about towel specifications, which is covered in my system knowledge about GSM meaning, Egyptian cotton benefits, and quality control processes.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent question! GSM stands for grams per square meter - it measures towel thickness and density. Our 600 GSM Egyptian cotton towels are quite luxurious. Egyptian cotton has longer fibers than regular cotton, which creates superior softness and enhanced durability. Each towel is individually inspected for softness and absorbency before reaching guest rooms.

user:
That explains why they feel so premium! The attention to detail here is impressive.
