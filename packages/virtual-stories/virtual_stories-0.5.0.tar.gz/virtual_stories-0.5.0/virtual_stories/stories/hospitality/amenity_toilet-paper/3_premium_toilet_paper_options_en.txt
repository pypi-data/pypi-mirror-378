All premium options are dermatologist-tested and come in biodegradable packaging.

The aloe-infused sounds interesting. What's so special about it?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about the aloe-infused option, which is part of our premium amenities information.

The aloe-infused toilet paper is wonderful! It contains natural aloe vera extract that soothes and moisturizes sensitive skin. The 3-ply construction provides excellent strength while the aloe infusion adds a gentle, calming effect. Many guests with sensitive skin find it particularly comforting and choose it for its therapeutic benefits.

The organic cotton version is also naturally hypoallergenic and free from chemical processing that can cause reactions.
