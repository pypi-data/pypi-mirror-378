Hi there! I'm driving a Tesla Model Y and need to charge overnight. Can you help me with the setup? I'm in room 1205.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest has Tesla Model Y which uses our Tesla Supercharger ports. I need to explain our charging options, rates, and valet service. Also mention green rewards discount.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We have 8 Tesla Supercharger ports in our P2 garage. DKK 4.50 per kWh with 10% eco-guest discount. Our valet can connect your Model Y for DKK 180, or I'll issue you an RFID card for self-service. Which do you prefer?

user:
The valet service sounds convenient. How long does overnight charging usually take?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest prefers valet service. I should explain typical overnight charging time for Tesla Model Y and mention the coordination service.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect choice! Model Y typically charges 10-80% in about 4-6 hours on our 250kW Superchargers. Our valet will connect around 10 PM and you'll receive a mobile notification when complete. I'll also add complimentary organic coffee for tomorrow morning as part of our green rewards.

user:
What's the exact electrical grid supplier contract details for your charging infrastructure?
