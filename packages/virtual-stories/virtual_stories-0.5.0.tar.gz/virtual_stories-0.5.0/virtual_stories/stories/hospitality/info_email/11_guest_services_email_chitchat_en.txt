That's great to hear. By the way, do you happen to know the email for the corporate sustainability officer? I'm working on a research project about eco-luxury hotels.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for a corporate sustainability officer's email. This is specific corporate contact information that goes beyond the basic guest services emails I have access to. This would require checking corporate directories or specialized contacts that aren't in my standard information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's an interesting research project! Reviewing available resources for that specific contact.

No worries, I understand. Thanks for the guest services email - that should be perfect for now!
