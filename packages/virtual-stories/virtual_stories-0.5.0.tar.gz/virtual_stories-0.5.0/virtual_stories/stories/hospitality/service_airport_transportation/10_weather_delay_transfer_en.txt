Hi! I'm dealing with a weather delay situation. My flight was supposed to leave at 2 PM but it's been delayed until 6 PM due to storms. I had originally scheduled a 1 PM pickup, but now I need to adjust. Can you help me reschedule my transportation?

The user has a weather delay and needs to reschedule their transportation from 1 PM to accommodate a 6 PM flight. I should book a new transfer time and offer our weather monitoring services.
