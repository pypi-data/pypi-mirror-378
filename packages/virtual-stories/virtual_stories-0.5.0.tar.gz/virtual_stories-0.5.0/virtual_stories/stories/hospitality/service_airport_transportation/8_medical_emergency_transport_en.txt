I need urgent medical transportation to the airport. My husband has a medical condition and needs to travel with oxygen equipment. Our flight is at 4 PM, so we need to leave around 2 PM. Can you arrange specialized medical transport?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user needs medical transportation with oxygen equipment for a 2 PM departure to catch a 4 PM flight. I should book a van (better for medical equipment) and ensure medical services are noted.
