Our landscaper will be thrilled you noticed the native columbines! I’ve set your stay to skip daily housekeeping with linens on request, and an eco kit (refillable bottle, bamboo toothbrush, detergent sheets) will arrive in ~10 minutes. If you change your mind, just text “HOUSEKEEPING” and we’ll adjust.
