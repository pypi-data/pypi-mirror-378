Found two excellent sustainable restaurants. Provide details and make reservations if requested.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice! I found two wonderful sustainable restaurants within walking distance. Green Fork Cafe (0.3 miles) is certified organic and specializes in farm-to-table vegetarian dishes. Earth & Vine (0.7 miles) has zero-waste practices and seasonal organic menus. Both use ingredients from our partner farms!

user:
Those sound perfect! I've been reading about Nashville's farm-to-table movement—it's really impressive.

Guest is engaging in chitchat about Nashville's food scene. Share information about local food culture.

assistant channel=final:
It truly is thriving! Nashville has become a Southern farm-to-table destination with over 50 urban farms within the city limits. Our resort's rooftop garden supplies herbs to both restaurants I recommended. The farmers market on Saturdays is incredible if you want to meet the local growers.

user:
I'd love to visit the farmers market! What's the best time to go?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest interested in farmers market. Provide timing and additional information.

assistant channel=final:
The Saturday market runs from 8 AM to 1 PM and is at its best around 10 AM when the crowds are manageable. You can take our complimentary shuttle or walk—it's just 0.5 miles. Many vendors accept digital payments only, which helps reduce paper waste.

user:
Perfect! I'll plan to go tomorrow morning. Thank you for the great recommendations.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest is satisfied with the information. Offer additional assistance.

assistant channel=final:
You're very welcome! I'll send you the market map and restaurant menus via email. Both Green Fork and Earth & Vine have reservation systems—would you like me to book a table for you during your stay?
