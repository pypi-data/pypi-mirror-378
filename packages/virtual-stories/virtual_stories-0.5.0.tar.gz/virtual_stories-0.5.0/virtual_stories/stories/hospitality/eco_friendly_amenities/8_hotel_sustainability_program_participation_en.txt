It truly is! Austin was one of the first cities to ban plastic bags and has a thriving network of urban farms. Our hotel is part of the city's "Sustainable Living District" initiative, which aims to make this neighborhood carbon-neutral by 2026. The community garden supplies herbs to over 20 local restaurants.

Our community garden supports biodiversity by planting native species that attract pollinators and provide habitats for local wildlife. The gardens reduce urban heat island effect and manage stormwater runoff naturally. We track our impact and have increased local bee populations by 40% since starting the program.
