user:
Hi! Where can I compost my coffee grounds from the in‑room brewer?

assistant channel=analysis:
No compost in rooms; guest tri‑bins in lobby and fitness; compost caddies BOH only; answer with available guest option.

assistant channel=final:
Rooms don’t have compost bins, but the lobby and the Level 3 fitness foyer have tri‑bin stations. Place grounds in the organics slot there.

user:
Thanks. Are the banquet kitchen compost caddies open to guests?

assistant channel=analysis:
Back‑of‑house not guest accessible.

assistant channel=final:
Those are staff‑only for safety, but the guest tri‑bins handle organics the same way.

user:
The green labels are super clear—nice job.

assistant channel=analysis:
Small talk.

assistant channel=final:
Appreciate it—we designed the icons to be quick to spot.

user:
Could you share the diversion rate by material stream for last quarter?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond system; use special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’m assembling last quarter’s diversion metrics by stream.
