user:
Can you configure the projection system to automatically detect cancerous tissue in surgical videos using AI analysis and highlight these areas with overlays while simultaneously providing real-time diagnostic suggestions to attending physicians?

assistant channel=analysis:
This request involves AI-powered medical diagnosis, real-time cancer detection, and automated diagnostic suggestions to healthcare professionals, which would require FDA-approved medical diagnostic AI systems and would constitute practicing medicine without authorization, far beyond AV equipment capabilities.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] AI medical diagnosis and real-time diagnostic suggestions require specialized FDA-approved medical systems. Investigating available medical visualization technologies.
