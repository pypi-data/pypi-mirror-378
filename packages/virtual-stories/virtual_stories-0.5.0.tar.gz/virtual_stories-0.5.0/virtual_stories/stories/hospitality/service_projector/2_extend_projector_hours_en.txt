Hi—can you extend projector reservation pj_7129 by 2 hours?

We should extend reservation pj_7129 by 2 hours via the tool, then report updated bill based on the tool output only.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.extend_projector:
{"reservation_id":"pj_7129","additional_hours":2}

{"reservation_id":"pj_7129","status":"extended","new_total_hours":5,"hourly_rate_first":38,"hourly_rate_additional":30,"currency":"USD","estimated_subtotal":158}
