The sound on my TV is really muffled and hard to hear. Can you help me fix it?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is experiencing audio issues with the TV. I can provide troubleshooting steps based on the detailed audio system configuration in the system prompt, including various audio modes and settings available.

assistant channel=final:
I can help troubleshoot the audio issue. First, try pressing the Sound button on your remote to cycle through audio modes - Movie mode often provides clearer dialogue. You can also access the Sound Settings menu to enable Voice Clarity, which uses AI to enhance speech. If the sound is still muffled, check that the volume isn't set too low and try the Night Mode setting, which reduces bass and enhances dialogue clarity.

user:
I tried those settings but it's still not clear. What other options do I have?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest has tried the basic troubleshooting but still has issues. I can suggest additional audio options from the system prompt, including Bluetooth connectivity and different audio formats.

assistant channel=final:
Let's try a few more options. You can connect wireless headphones via Bluetooth 5.2 for personal audio, or use the 3.5mm headphone jack if you have wired headphones. Also, try switching to the Music audio mode, which often provides clearer mid-range frequencies. If you're watching content with Dolby Atmos or DTS:X, make sure those audio formats are properly enabled in the sound settings.

user:
The view from this room is incredible - I can see the entire city!

assistant channel=analysis:
This is casual small talk about the hotel's view, which relates to the 34th-floor skyline lounge and panoramic Manhattan views mentioned in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Isn't it amazing? Our 34th-floor location gives you those spectacular panoramic Manhattan views. Many guests love spending time in our skyline lounge with those floor-to-ceiling windows, especially during sunset when the city lights start coming on.

user:
Can you remotely adjust the TV's audio settings or send a technician to calibrate the sound system professionally?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about remote audio adjustments or professional calibration services, which goes beyond what's available in the system prompt. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since no tools or system knowledge covers remote audio management or professional calibration services.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I understand your request. Reviewing available resources.
