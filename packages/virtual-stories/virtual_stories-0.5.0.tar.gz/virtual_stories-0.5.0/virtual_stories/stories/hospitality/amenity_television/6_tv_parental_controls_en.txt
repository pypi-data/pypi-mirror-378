Hi! I'm staying in room 2217 with my children and I'd like to set up parental controls on the TV. What options are available?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide parental control information from system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
Great question! Your Samsung QLED TV has comprehensive parental controls. You can set content rating restrictions (G, PG, PG-13, R), block specific channels, set time-based viewing restrictions, and create PIN protection for settings. There are also streaming app parental controls, safe search mode, and educational content recommendations. You can even create a kids' profile for child-friendly content.

user:
That's perfect! How do I access the parental control settings?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide guidance on accessing parental control settings.

assistant channel=final:
To access parental controls, press the Menu button on your remote, then navigate to Settings > General > Parental Controls. You'll need to create a PIN first, then you can set up content restrictions, channel blocking, and time limits. The system will guide you through each step.

user:
Excellent! The kids' profile creation sounds very helpful for my children.

assistant channel=analysis:
Acknowledge their interest in the kids' profile feature without adding new information.

assistant channel=final:
The kids' profile is perfect for families - it automatically filters content to be age-appropriate and educational!

user:
Do you have any educational programming recommendations for children?

assistant channel=analysis:
Educational programming recommendations aren't specifically mentioned in system prompt, so use attention flag.
