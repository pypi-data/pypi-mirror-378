Hi—TV in room 2217 says “No Signal.” Can you help me get it working?

assistant channel=analysis:
Run a remote diagnostic on room 2217 to confirm input state and signal; if needed, dispatch technician.

tool.diagnose_tv_issue channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"powered_on":true,"active_input":"HDMI1","signal":"none","recommendation":"switch_to_tv_tuner_or_hdmi2","panel_controls_available":true}

assistant channel=analysis:
Recommend input change per tool output; offer technician if guest prefers hands-on help.

assistant channel=final:
Thanks for the details—your TV is on HDMI1 with no signal. Please press Input and select either TV Tuner or HDMI2; that should restore the picture. If you’d like, I can also send a technician to room 2217 to handle it for you.

user:
Please do send someone. Also, can you turn on Guest Streaming Mode so I can sign in to my apps?

assistant channel=analysis:
Dispatch technician with reason; then enable guest streaming mode for privacy.

All set—Marco is on the way in about 12 minutes, and Guest Streaming Mode is enabled for room 2217 with automatic credential clearing at checkout.

user:
That skyline lounge view last night was stunning.

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer a friendly acknowledgment tied to the lounge fact.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a favorite—the 34th-floor lounge has full-height windows for that sweeping view.

user:
Could you install a third‑party app on the TV for me?

assistant channel=analysis:
App installation beyond Guest Streaming Mode isn’t provided by tools or system; acknowledge and use background flag.
