That sounds wonderful. How many housekeeping staff members are typically assigned to turndown service?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about housekeeping staffing for turndown service. This information is not available in my system knowledge - I only have details about service windows and amenities, not internal staffing numbers.

By the way, what's the weather like outside tonight?

The guest is asking about the weather. This is a casual question that doesn't require system information or tools - it's just small talk about current conditions. I can provide a general response since weather isn't part of our hotel services.

Could you tell me about the resort's sustainability initiatives?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about sustainability initiatives. This information is available in my system knowledge - I can see we have details about being a 5-star resort with various amenities, but specific sustainability programs aren't mentioned. I should use the [ATTENTION] flag since this goes beyond the available context.
