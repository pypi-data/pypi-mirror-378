My coffee maker in 1922 won’t turn on at all.

assistant channel=analysis:
Ask to confirm the outlet switch; check status after.

assistant channel=final:
Please flip the small outlet switch next to the minibar—this controls the machine. If it still won’t power, I’ll check the status now.

user:
I flipped it—still nothing.

Thanks for checking—the unit reports a power fault. I can arrange a replacement immediately with typical arrival in about 10–15 minutes.

The harbor lights sound lovely.

They come on around dusk along the walkway—worth a quick look.

Is there a late-night bakery nearby?
