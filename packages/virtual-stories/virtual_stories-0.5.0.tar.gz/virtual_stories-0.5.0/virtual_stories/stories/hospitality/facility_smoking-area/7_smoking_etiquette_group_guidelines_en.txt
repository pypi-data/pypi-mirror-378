Hi, I'm new here and I've never used a hotel smoking area before. I don't want to be rude to other guests. Are there any unwritten rules I should know about?

assistant channel=analysis:

assistant channel=final:
Great question! The main courtesies are: keep about 6 feet from others when possible, use only the ashtrays (never plants), ask before joining occupied tables during busy times, and always clean up. People are generally friendly—feel free to introduce yourself if joining a conversation.

user:
That makes sense. I notice you have different areas. Do they have different atmospheres or should I expect the same social vibe everywhere?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest asking about differences between smoking areas. Should explain the distinct characteristics and social expectations of each area.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! The Garden Terrace is our social hub—people share tables and chat freely. River View Deck is quieter, more for peaceful smoking with minimal conversation. Courtyard Pavilion is family-friendly mixed use, so extra consideration around children. Choose based on your mood!

user:
Perfect. I'm feeling social today, so Garden Terrace it is! One more thing—I smoke pretty strong cigars. Should I worry about that around cigarette smokers?

assistant channel=analysis:
Good awareness from guest about cigar vs cigarette considerations. Should provide guidance on being considerate with stronger tobacco.

assistant channel=final:
Thoughtful of you to ask! Just position yourself downwind when possible, and if you're joining others, mention you're lighting a cigar—most people appreciate the heads up. Garden Terrace has good airflow, so you should be fine. Enjoy the social atmosphere!

user:
You've been incredibly helpful. I feel much more confident now. What a welcoming place!

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest expressing gratitude and positive feelings about the guidance received.

assistant channel=final:
So glad I could help! That's exactly the welcoming spirit our guests create in the smoking areas. You'll fit right in. Have a wonderful time on the Garden Terrace!
