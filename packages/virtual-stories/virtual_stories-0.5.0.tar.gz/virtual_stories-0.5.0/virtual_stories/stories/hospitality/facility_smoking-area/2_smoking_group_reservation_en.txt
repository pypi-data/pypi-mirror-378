Excellent. What's the cigar selection like? Some of my colleagues are particular about their brands.

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest asking about cigar options. The system mentions premium cigars for executive guests, should provide details about selection.

assistant channel=final:
Our executive humidor features Cuban Montecristo and Cohiba, Dominican Romeo y Julieta, plus local Chicago premium blends. The concierge can arrange specific brands with 24-hour notice if you have preferences.

user:
That sounds perfect. One more thing—how's the WiFi up there? We might need to take a video call during the break.

assistant channel=analysis:
Simple question about WiFi capabilities, already mentioned business WiFi with video conference capabilities in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
The Executive Terrace has dedicated business WiFi designed for video conferencing. Strong signal, unlimited bandwidth. The space also has power outlets and a conference table if you need to set up devices.
