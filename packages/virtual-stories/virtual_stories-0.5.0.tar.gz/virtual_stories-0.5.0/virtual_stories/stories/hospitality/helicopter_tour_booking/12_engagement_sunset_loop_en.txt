Hi there! Big day—feeling nervous and excited. Any tips?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer encouragement and mention audio cue feature and deck photographer.

assistant channel=final:
Congratulations in advance—that’s a wonderful moment. We can ask the pilot to trigger a discreet audio cue right as you pass Lighthouse Point. Many guests also book our deck photographer 30 minutes before departure (USD 180) for candid shots before you board.

user:
Can we do the 18:40 loop and have champagne before boarding?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm time and champagne add-on policy.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—the 18:40 sunset loop is perfect. The champagne add-on (USD 75) is served pre-boarding at the Viewing Deck with plastic flutes; no glass items are allowed on the helicopter.

user:
We’re two people, about 160 kg combined. Any limits we should know?
