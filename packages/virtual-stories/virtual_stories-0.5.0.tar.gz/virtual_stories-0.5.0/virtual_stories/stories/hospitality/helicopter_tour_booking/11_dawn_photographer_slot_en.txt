Good morning! The dawn light here is gorgeous. How are you today?

assistant channel=analysis:
Offer small talk back, then introduce sunrise window and options.

assistant channel=final:
It is a beautiful morning—thanks for saying so. I’m well, and I hope you’re enjoying the pre-dawn calm. For sunrise flights, our Helipad H-3 operates from 05:30 with the key light window 06:00–07:00. We can book a 25-minute (USD 420) or 45-minute (USD 690) tour for up to three guests.

user:
I’m a photographer—can we do door-off for the 45-minute slot at sunrise?

assistant channel=analysis:
Confirm partner HZ-W, door-off add-on cost and harness briefing timing.

assistant channel=final:
Yes. Door-off flights are available with Horizon Wings (HZ-W) only. The add-on is USD 120, and we’ll do a 15-minute safety harness briefing before takeoff. Closed-toe shoes are required, and we’ll check crosswinds to ensure they’re below 15 knots.

user:
I’ll bring two extra batteries and a small tripod—any restrictions?

assistant channel=analysis:
Recall battery policy and tripod packing.

assistant channel=final:
You can bring up to two spare lithium-ion batteries per passenger as long as they’re in protective bags. Tripods are fine if soft-packed. Also note the total passenger plus gear weight limit is 250 kg.

user:
If fog lingers, how do you handle delays and refunds?

assistant channel=analysis:
Explain fog delays and cancellation policy.

assistant channel=final:
If visibility drops below 5 km, we delay in 20-minute increments, often clearing by 07:15. You can cancel with a full refund up to 12 hours prior; after that, cancellations incur a 50% fee.

user:
Can you check the live METAR and file the flight plan for me right now?
