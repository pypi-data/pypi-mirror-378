Good afternoon! I've traveled from London specifically to experience your legendary tea collection. I understand you have some of the rarest vintage teas in England. Might I request your 1920s Darjeeling first flush? I've been a collector for over twenty years and this would be extraordinary.

assistant channel=analysis:
Sophisticated tea collector requesting rare vintage 1920s Darjeeling first flush. Should provide the tea and mention other rare vintage teas and formal tea service traditions that would appeal to a serious connoisseur.

assistant channel=final:
Good afternoon, and what an honor to serve a true connoisseur! I'll arrange for our 1920s Darjeeling first flush—carefully preserved in our manor wine cellars—to be served to you in our oak-paneled drawing room with proper ceremony. This extraordinary vintage exhibits the delicate muscatel character that made those early estate harvests legendary. For a collector of your caliber, you might also appreciate our aged pu-erh that's been cellaring here for over thirty years, or perhaps our royal blend created exclusively for Queen Victoria's visits to the manor.

How magnificent! The thought of that aged pu-erh is intriguing—I rarely encounter properly aged teas outside of China.

assistant channel=analysis:
Connoisseur showing interest in the aged pu-erh tea. Should explain the unique cellaring conditions and mention the formal tea service experience.

assistant channel=final:
Indeed, our pu-erh benefits from the unique climate conditions of our 16th-century wine cellars—the natural limestone walls and consistent temperature create ideal aging conditions rarely found outside traditional Chinese tea caves. I'll arrange for both teas to be served with our finest Royal Worcester bone china from 1860, accompanied by live chamber music on period instruments. The complete experience honors both the tea's heritage and the manor's Victorian tea traditions.

user:
Splendid! I'm curious about the provenance of your Earl Grey—do you know which specific bergamot oil is used in your blend?

assistant channel=analysis:
Connoisseur asking specific details about bergamot oil provenance in Earl Grey blend, which requires detailed sourcing knowledge beyond general system information. Need ATTENTION flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] That's an excellent question about our Earl Grey's specific provenance. Examining the possibilities.
