Good evening, and welcome to our Arctic paradise! For extended photography sessions in our extreme cold, I'll prepare our lingonberry and juniper circulation blend—it's specially formulated to keep your extremities warm during long aurora watches. I'll also include our sea buckthorn tea loaded with omega oils for skin protection, and traditional Sami reindeer milk tea with natural fats for sustained energy throughout those magical midnight hours.

Our photography guides know the optimal locations on Kiilopää Fell, and we have professional cold-weather camera equipment if you need backup gear. The combination of warming teas and our heated viewing areas will keep you comfortable for hours of shooting.
