Hi! We're in room 815 with our two kids (ages 5 and 8). We saw some snacks in the minibar but want to make sure they're suitable for children. What kid-friendly options do you have?

All our children's snacks are organic and nutritious. We also offer family movie nights with popcorn stations. Would you like me to customize your minibar for your family?

user:
Yes, please! The kids would love the animal-shaped fruit snacks. We're here for a family vacation. What activities do you have for kids their age?

Our family cooking classes are incredibly popular! Families love creating healthy meals together, learning new recipes, and making memories in the kitchen. Many guests tell us it's their favorite bonding experience during their stay.

That does sound special! Are there any family attractions or amusement parks nearby that you recommend?

The parent is asking about external family attractions and amusement parks. This goes beyond our resort's family amenities and requires information about external facilities.
