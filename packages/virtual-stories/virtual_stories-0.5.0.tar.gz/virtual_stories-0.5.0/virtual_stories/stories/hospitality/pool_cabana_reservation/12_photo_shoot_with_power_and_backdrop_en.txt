user:
I’m doing a portrait session—can I reserve a cabana with power for lights around 10 AM?

assistant channel=analysis:
Match quiet period and power.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—10 AM aligns with a quieter window, and each cabana has two outlets. We can provide an extension if needed.

user:
Sweet. Do you have a clean neutral backdrop option?

assistant channel=analysis:
We can mention canopy and neutral curtain if requested? Not in system; stick to available info.

assistant channel=final:
We can position you to use the canopy shade with a simple background. If you’d like, we’ll choose the cabana with the least visual clutter.

user:
By the way, your pool looks amazing. How long did the renovation take?

assistant channel=analysis:
Chitchat—avoid fabricating specifics.

assistant channel=final:
Appreciate it—guests have really enjoyed the refreshed look this season.

user:
Can you grant commercial usage rights of the hotel’s brand and logo for my campaign?

assistant channel=analysis:
Beyond ops; escalate and end.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Understood. The request for brand and logo commercial usage rights is being processed now.
