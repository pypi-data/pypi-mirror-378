Which seats are quiet and have strong power for my laptop?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use the tool to confirm outlets and nearby noise sources; combine with system’s best-quiet seats.

{"seats":{"A1":{"outlets":2,"near":"hvac"},"A3":{"outlets":3,"usb_c":true},"B3":{"outlets":3,"usb_c":true},"B4":{"outlets":3,"usb_c":true},"B5":{"outlets":2,"usb_c":true}},"notes":"Door near A1; quietest cluster B3–B5"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Recommend B3–B5 with USB‑C and away from vents/door.

assistant channel=final:
Pick B3–B5 for the quiet zone and solid power—each has 2–3 outlets plus USB‑C, and they’re furthest from the door and HVAC vents.

user:
This view helps me focus.

assistant channel=analysis:
Light small talk.

assistant channel=final:
The bay window puts the skyline right at the edge of your notes.

user:
Can you add an external monitor to B4 for me?

assistant channel=analysis:
No monitor provisioning is defined—flag it.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Adding a monitor to B4 is requested. I’m checking whether that can be arranged.
