Two adjacent events today: an artist talk 11:30–12:10 (moderate) and a string trio rehearsal 17:15–18:00 (low). Quiet hours 13:00–17:00 are unaffected. For the calmest spots, choose tables 7–10 away from exhibit speakers.

Sounds manageable—thanks.

assistant channel=analysis:
Short, friendly reply.

assistant channel=final:
Glad it fits your quiet window.

user:
Could you have the trio play softly during quiet hours tomorrow?

assistant channel=analysis:
Changing performer behavior isn’t defined—flag attention.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Your request about adjusting tomorrow’s rehearsal volume is noted. I’m checking options with the team.
