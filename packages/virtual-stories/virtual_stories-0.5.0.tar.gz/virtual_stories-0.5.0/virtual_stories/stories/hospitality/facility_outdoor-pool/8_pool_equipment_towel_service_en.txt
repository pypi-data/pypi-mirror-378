That's great! What about the changing rooms and lockers? How do those work?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about changing rooms and lockers. I have information about poolside changing rooms with lockers from the system prompt, and I can explain how the locker system works and what amenities are available in the changing rooms.

Our poolside changing rooms are fully equipped and very convenient! They feature lockers with key access where you can securely store your personal items while you enjoy the pool. The changing rooms are cleaned daily and maintained to the highest standards.

The lockers are spacious enough for your clothes, personal items, and valuables, and the key system ensures your belongings are secure. The changing rooms also have heated rinse showers with rainfall heads, so you can freshen up before and after swimming.

The changing rooms are accessible with grab bars and wide doorways, and they're designed for comfort and privacy. You can use the lockers throughout your pool visit, and our staff is available if you need any assistance with the locker system.

Perfect! What about pool toys and floatation devices? Are there any age restrictions or safety requirements?

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking about pool toys and floatation devices, specifically about age restrictions and safety requirements. I have information about complimentary pool toys for children and floatation devices available upon request, but I should explain the safety guidelines and any restrictions.

assistant channel=final:
Great question! We provide complimentary pool toys for children, and pool noodles and floatation devices are available upon request. All equipment is sanitized between uses to ensure hygiene and safety.

For safety, children under 12 must be supervised by adults at all times, and this applies to using any pool equipment as well. Our certified lifeguards are on duty during peak hours (10:00 AM to 6:00 PM) and can provide guidance on safe equipment use.

The pool depth ranges from 1.1m at the shallow end to 1.4m at the deep end, so we recommend appropriate floatation devices based on swimming ability and comfort level. Our staff can help you select the right equipment for your needs and ensure everyone stays safe while having fun.
