You're in the perfect location for Beverly Hills shopping! Since we're right on Rodeo Drive, you can step outside and find Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton, and Chanel all within walking distance. Robertson Boulevard is fantastic for unique boutiques and local designers. We also offer personal shopping concierge services if you'd like a guided experience. What type of shopping interests you most?

user:
We're interested in unique local designers and maybe some vintage finds. Robertson Boulevard sounds perfect! Is there a good time to go to avoid crowds?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is interested in Robertson Boulevard and wants crowd avoidance tips. I should provide specific timing recommendations and additional details.

assistant channel=final:
Robertson Boulevard is ideal for unique finds and local designers! For fewer crowds, go early on weekdays—aim for 11:00 AM when the shops open. The street has a great creative vibe with vintage stores, art galleries, and one-of-a-kind boutiques. Many designers have their own ateliers there. Would you like our complimentary car service to take you there?

user:
Actually, since we're staying right on Rodeo Drive, maybe we should explore that first. But I do want to check out Robertson too. Could you recommend a good itinerary for the day?

assistant channel=analysis:
