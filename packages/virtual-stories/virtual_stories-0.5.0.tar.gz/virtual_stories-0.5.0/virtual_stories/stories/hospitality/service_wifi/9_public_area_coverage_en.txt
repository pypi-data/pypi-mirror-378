I'm working remotely during my stay. Can you give me WiFi access for the public areas? I'm in room 1902 under Williams.

Great for remote work! Use Downtown_Public with password "Work-Remote-1902" in our lobby, rooftop terrace, business center, and executive lounge. Each area offers 50 Mbps bandwidth with dedicated workspaces.

user:
Perfect! The rooftop terrace sounds amazing. What's the view like?

assistant channel=final:
The rooftop offers panoramic city views with the skyline, harbor, and mountains in the distance. It's weather-protected with heaters for cooler evenings, and we have a coffee bar up there too.

user:
Do you have any quiet areas for video calls?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about quiet areas for video calls, which is information that's available in the hotel's public area amenities.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We have soundproofed phone booths on the 2nd floor and meeting pods in the executive lounge - both perfect for video calls. The booths are available 24/7 with premium lighting and whiteboards.
