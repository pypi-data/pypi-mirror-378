Arigatou gozaimasu. The hotel is very beautiful. Do you have Japanese restaurants nearby?

assistant channel=final:
The guest is asking about Japanese restaurants nearby. This information should be available in the hotel's directory or concierge system, but I need to check if this is within my knowledge scope.
