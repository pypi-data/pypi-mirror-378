Hey! Gorgeous sunset from the deck tonight. I think my stainless watch hitched a ride with the towel bin.

It’s a great show this evening. After 19:00, towels head to Laundry around 19:15, and any valuables found are routed to Security by 19:30. Watches are held for 60 days, and we record model/serial when possible.

It has “To N.” engraved near the clasp. Can you check for that and send me a photo to confirm?

assistant channel=analysis:
Use claim verification and secure photo link.

assistant channel=final:
That engraving is a helpful identifier. If a watch matches, I’ll email you a secure photo link so you can confirm the engraving before pickup.

user:
Could you pair it with my phone right now to prove it’s mine?
