Hi! Your piano playlist is so calming. I think I left my grey laptop bag on the long couch by the ficus.

Small talk; explain electronics go to Tech Cage shelf B and retention 45 days.

Glad it set the tone—that’s our afternoon jazz mix. For laptop bags, we intake at Front Desk Lane 2 on the blue LNF-B form. Electronics are sealed and stored on Tech Cage shelf B, and we hold them for 45 days.

It might’ve been drizzling when I came in. Will you power it on to check?

assistant channel=analysis:
Reference water exposure protocol: dry 24h with desiccant before any power-on test.

assistant channel=final:
We won’t power it on immediately. If there’s moisture, we place it with desiccant for 24 hours before any checks—that helps avoid damage. We’ll text you from +1-555-0142 once there’s an update.

Could you ping its "Find My" signal from your end to speed this up?
