Could you also check if there are any sharp pieces I might have missed?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about additional safety inspection, which goes beyond our standard cleanup protocol. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag since detailed safety inspection isn't covered in our system knowledge.

[ATTENTION] I understand you'd like a thorough safety inspection. Reviewing available resources.
