Hi! I'm organizing a spa day for 5 friends next month. Do you offer any group discounts?

assistant channel=analysis:
Provide group booking information from system prompt including discount rates.

assistant channel=final:
Yes! We offer group discounts for bookings of 4 or more people. For groups of 4-6 people, you get a 10% discount, and for groups of 7 or more, it's 15% off. We require advance booking and you can mix different treatments within your group. What treatments are you considering?

user:
We're thinking about the relaxation package. What would the total cost be for 5 people?

assistant channel=analysis:
Calculate the group discount for 5 people with relaxation packages.

assistant channel=final:
For 5 people with the relaxation package, that would be 5 × HKD 980 = HKD 4,900, with a 10% group discount bringing it down to HKD 4,410. Each person gets the 60-minute massage plus sauna access, robes, and slippers.

user:

The dry sauna with Himalayan salt walls is definitely a popular spot for memorable moments with friends!
