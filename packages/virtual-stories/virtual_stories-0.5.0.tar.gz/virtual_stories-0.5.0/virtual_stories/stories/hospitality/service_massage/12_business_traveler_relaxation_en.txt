Great! I've been in meetings since 7 AM - my shoulders are killing me from sitting all day.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is sharing about their long day of meetings and shoulder tension. This is casual conversation about their work day, so I should respond empathetically and perhaps mention how our massage can help with the specific tension they're experiencing.

assistant channel=final:
I completely understand - those marathon meeting days can really take a toll on your shoulders and neck. Our therapists are experienced with addressing the specific tension that comes from prolonged sitting and computer work. The 60-minute session will give plenty of time to work on those tight shoulder muscles.
