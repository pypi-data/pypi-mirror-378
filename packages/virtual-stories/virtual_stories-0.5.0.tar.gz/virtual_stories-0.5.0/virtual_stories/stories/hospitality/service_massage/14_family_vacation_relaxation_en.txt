Hi! I'm here with my family for vacation and would love to book a massage while the kids are at the kids club. What are my options?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is a parent on family vacation who wants to book a massage while their children are at the kids club. I should provide information about our family-friendly massage services, emphasizing the timing that works well with kids club hours and the family-safe amenities.

Perfect timing! Our family-friendly in-room massage services offer 60-minute ($125) or 90-minute ($175) sessions with service hours 09:00–21:00. Last starts are 19:30 for 60-minute and 18:30 for 90-minute sessions. Each service includes a portable massage table, family-safe hypoallergenic linens, and child-friendly essential oils. Our licensed family therapist arrives 10 minutes early for setup and safety check. The kids club runs 8:00-20:00 with supervised activities, so you'll have plenty of time to relax. What duration works best for you?

Great! The kids are so excited about the water slides at the family pool. They've been talking about it all morning.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is sharing about their children's excitement about the water slides. This is casual conversation about their family vacation activities, so I should respond warmly and perhaps mention the family amenities that complement their experience.

assistant channel=final:
That's wonderful! The water slides are always a hit with kids - they're designed to be fun but safe with our lifeguard on duty. The family pool also has a shallow end for younger children and a poolside snack bar for when they work up an appetite. It sounds like your family is going to have an amazing vacation!

Do you offer any packages that include both massage and access to the teen zone for my older kids?
