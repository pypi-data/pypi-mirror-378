As for sunset viewing, you have several amazing options right here at the resort:

2. **Pool Deck Bar** - Enjoy sunset drinks while watching the colors change over the ocean
3. **Dining Terrace** - Many guests watch from our oceanfront restaurant with a cocktail

The beachfront lawn is particularly magical - we even have complimentary sunset snacks and Hawaiian music on many evenings. Have you been to Hawaii before, or is this your first visit?

First time in Hawaii - you're in for a treat! The sunsets here are absolutely spectacular.

**Kids Club Meals & Snacks:**

Since it's your first visit, I recommend trying our signature kids' meal: Loco Moco (rice, hamburger patty, and egg) with a side of fresh pineapple. The children love it!

Is there anything else you'd like to know about the program or activities? I can also suggest some family-friendly sunset activities if you're interested.
