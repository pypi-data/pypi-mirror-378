Hi! We're here with our three kids - ages 4, 8, and 15. I need to give my mother-in-law the hotel's full address so she knows exactly where we are, and also in case we need anything delivered.

assistant channel=analysis:
Family guest needs complete address for emergency contact and delivery purposes. They have children of different ages so I should also be helpful about family amenities.

user:
That sounds amazing! The weather looks perfect for the beach today.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! Our private beach has family zones and the water's been beautiful this week. Are you planning to try any water sports?

user:
Maybe tomorrow! Quick question - do you know if there are any good ice cream shops within walking distance of the hotel?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about nearby ice cream shops, which is local area information beyond what I have in my hotel amenities and services. This requires the [ATTENTION] flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'm gathering information about nearby dining options for you.
