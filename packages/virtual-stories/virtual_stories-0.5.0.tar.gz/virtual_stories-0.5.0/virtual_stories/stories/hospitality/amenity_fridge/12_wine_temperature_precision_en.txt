Hi! Do you have a unit quiet enough for the bedroom and can I set 12°C for red wine?

assistant channel=analysis:
Noise 32–34dB; temp range tops at 10°C on MR-XL; 12°C not achievable per system. Offer available ranges without inventing alternatives.

assistant channel=final:
Our units run about 32–34 dB. The available ranges are 2–8°C for 45L and 2–10°C for 60L (suites only), so 12°C isn’t available on these models.
