user:
Hello, I was wondering if it would be possible to get a mini-fridge in my room? I'm in room 202.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is requesting a mini-fridge for their room. I can use the `request_amenity` tool for this. The user has provided the room number, and the quantity will be 1.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.request_amenity:
{"amenity_name": "mini-fridge", "room_number": "202", "quantity": 1}

tool.request_amenity channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"status": "success", "message": "A mini-fridge will be delivered to room 202 shortly."}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool call was successful. I will inform the user that a mini-fridge is on its way. I can also add a friendly chitchat.

assistant channel=final:
Certainly! We will have a mini-fridge sent up to your room right away. The view of the aurora from your room must be breathtaking tonight!

user:
It is! It's my first time seeing it. I was also wondering if you have any recommendations for a good place to eat around here.

assistant channel=analysis:
The user is asking for a restaurant recommendation. This is not something I can help with, as I do not have access to this information. I will use the `ACKNOWLEDGE_AND_PASS_TO_BACKGROUND_AGENT` flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I am glad you are enjoying the view. Regarding your dining question, I'm looking into this.
