Perfect timing is everything for a romantic sunset! Our "Golden Hour" package is specifically designed for the most beautiful lighting, typically starting around 6:30 PM this time of year. We'll arrange everything to begin 30 minutes before sunset so you can enjoy the full golden hour experience. The private terrace provides unobstructed views of the Aegean Sea, and our butler will serve champagne and arrange the rose petals just as the sun begins to set. We can also arrange romantic photography to capture these precious moments if you'd like!
