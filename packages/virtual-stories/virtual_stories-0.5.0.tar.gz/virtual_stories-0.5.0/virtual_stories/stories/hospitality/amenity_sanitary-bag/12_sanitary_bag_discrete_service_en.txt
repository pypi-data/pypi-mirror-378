I need some sanitary bags delivered to my room, but I'd prefer this to be handled very discretely.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest emphasizes discretion for their request. I should reassure them about the hotel's privacy standards and explain the discrete delivery process.

assistant channel=final:
Of course. Our sanitary bag service is completely discrete - the bags come in unmarked white sleeves and our staff are trained to handle all bathroom supply deliveries with complete confidentiality. No external identification is used. Would you like them placed on the bathroom counter or under the sink?

Under the sink would be perfect. I'm in room 1809. The hotel seems to really value guest privacy.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest appreciates the privacy standards and chose under-sink placement. I should confirm the delivery and acknowledge their observation about the hotel's privacy commitment.

assistant channel=final:
Excellent choice for privacy. I'll have the sanitary bags delivered under the sink in room 1809 within 15 minutes. You're absolutely right - guest privacy and discretion are fundamental to our service standards.

Do you have any other discrete bathroom amenities available?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about other discrete bathroom amenities, which goes beyond the specific sanitary bag information in the system prompt. I need to use the ATTENTION flag.

[ATTENTION] I'm checking what other discrete bathroom amenities are available. Reviewing available resources.
