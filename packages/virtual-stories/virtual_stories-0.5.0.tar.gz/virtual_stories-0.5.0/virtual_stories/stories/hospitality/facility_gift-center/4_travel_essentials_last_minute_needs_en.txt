I'm heading to a business conference in Chicago. The weather looks unpredictable, so maybe I should get some emergency supplies too.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is going to a business conference in Chicago with unpredictable weather. I should suggest weather-appropriate emergency supplies and business travel essentials.

assistant channel=final:
Smart thinking! Chicago weather can definitely be unpredictable. I'd recommend an emergency poncho at $8, hand warmers at $6, and a portable water bottle at $12. For business travel, you might also want a basic first-aid kit at $18 and some energy bars at $6 for long conference days. We also have emergency contact cards that you can fill out with your hotel and emergency contacts. The total for your charger, power bank, and these emergency supplies would be about $110. Would you like me to put together a business travel essentials bundle for you?
