Great! I have comprehensive information about our gift wrapping and shipping services. I can provide detailed options for both services.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We offer several gift wrapping options to make your gifts special. Our standard wrapping is $8 per item with elegant paper and ribbon, premium wrapping is $12 with luxury paper and satin ribbon, and luxury wrapping is $18 with designer paper and silk ribbon. For shipping, we offer domestic delivery through USPS, FedEx, and UPS with delivery times ranging from 1-5 business days. We also have express services for next-day delivery and special handling for fragile items. What type of gifts are you sending, and where are they going? I can help you choose the best wrapping and shipping options.

I'm sending some local artisan pottery and a hotel robe to my parents in California. I'd like nice wrapping but not too expensive, and I need it to arrive safely since pottery can be fragile.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is sending fragile pottery and a hotel robe to California. I should recommend appropriate wrapping and shipping options that ensure safe delivery of fragile items.

{"destination": "California", "package_weight": "medium", "service_type": "fragile_handling"}

tool.calculate_shipping_costs channel=commentary to=assistant:
{"shipping_options": [{"service": "FedEx Ground with fragile handling", "cost": 18, "delivery_time": "3-5 business days", "insurance": "Included up to $100"}, {"service": "UPS Standard with special handling", "cost": 22, "delivery_time": "2-3 business days", "insurance": "Included up to $100"}], "fragile_packaging": "Bubble wrap, foam padding, custom inserts, secure boxes", "total_wrapping_cost": "Premium wrapping recommended at $12 per item"}

assistant channel=analysis:
Perfect! I can recommend appropriate options for their fragile pottery and robe. Premium wrapping would be good for the price point, and I should emphasize the fragile handling options.

assistant channel=final:
Perfect choices for your parents! For the pottery, I'd recommend our premium wrapping at $12 per item - it includes luxury paper with satin ribbon and will look beautiful. For shipping, since pottery is fragile, I'd suggest FedEx Ground with special fragile handling at $18, which includes bubble wrap, foam padding, and custom inserts to ensure safe delivery. The total would be about $42 for wrapping and shipping. We'll pack everything very carefully and provide tracking information. Would you like me to set this up for you?

user:
That sounds perfect! The premium wrapping and fragile handling will give me peace of mind. Can you add a gift message to the package?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is confirming their order and asking about adding a gift message. I should confirm their order and provide information about gift messaging services.

assistant channel=final:
Absolutely! We can definitely add a gift message to the package. We include a beautiful gift tag with your personal message, and we can also add a thank you card if you'd like. The gift message is complimentary with our premium wrapping service. What would you like the message to say? We'll make sure it's elegantly presented with the wrapped gifts.

user:
The gift center really thinks of everything for travelers!

assistant channel=analysis:
This is positive feedback about the gift center's comprehensive services. I should acknowledge their appreciation and maybe add some encouraging details.

assistant channel=final:
Thank you so much! We try to make gift-giving as easy and special as possible, especially for travelers who want to share their experience with loved ones back home. It's wonderful to see how much thought you're putting into these gifts for your parents.

user:
Do you offer any international shipping to countries outside the US? I have some friends in Europe who would love some local crafts.

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about international shipping to Europe. This information is available in my system prompt - I have information about international shipping services.

assistant channel=final:
Yes, we do offer international shipping! For Europe, we have several options: USPS International Priority takes 6-10 business days, FedEx International takes 3-7 business days, and DHL Express takes 2-5 business days. We can ship most of our local artisan crafts internationally, though some items may have restrictions. We also provide all the necessary customs documentation and tracking information. The shipping costs vary by destination and package weight, but we can calculate exact costs when you're ready to ship. What country in Europe are you thinking of sending to?
