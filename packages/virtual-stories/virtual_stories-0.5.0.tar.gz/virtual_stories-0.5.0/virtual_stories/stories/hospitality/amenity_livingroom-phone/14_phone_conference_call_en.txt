Good afternoon! Yes, absolutely! The living room phone supports conference calls with up to 6 participants. To set it up, first call one participant normally, then press the "Add Call" button, dial the next number, and press "Conference" to merge the calls.

That sounds straightforward. Does the phone have speakerphone capability for hands-free operation?

Yes! The phone has a built-in speakerphone that provides excellent hands-free operation. It's perfect for conference calls and gives you HD audio quality. You can activate it by pressing the speakerphone button, which makes it much easier to manage multiple participants.

Excellent! What if I need to speak privately with just one person during the conference?

The guest is asking about private conversations during conference calls. I have information about the "Private" feature that allows speaking with one participant privately.

Great question! You can press the "Private" button during the conference call to speak with just one participant privately. When you're done with the private conversation, press "Conference" again to return to the group call. This feature is very useful for confidential discussions.
