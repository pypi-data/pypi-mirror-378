Good morning! I need to call my family in London. How do I make an international call from the living room phone?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest wants to make an international call to London from the living room phone. I have information about international calling procedures, including the UK country code (44) and the dialing format (0 + country code + number).

assistant channel=final:
Good morning! To call London from the living room phone, dial 0 + 44 + the London number (without the leading 0). For example, if the London number is 020-1234-5678, you'd dial 0-44-20-1234-5678. The rate is $0.25 per minute and charges will appear on your final bill.

user:
Perfect! What time is it in London right now?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for the current time in London. This information isn't available in my system knowledge - I don't have access to real-time time zone information.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] Let me check the current time in London for you.

user:
That's okay, I can check on my phone. One more thing - are there any cheaper alternatives for calling internationally?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking about cheaper alternatives for international calling. I have information about using the hotel's complimentary WiFi for video calls as an alternative to the phone system.

assistant channel=final:
Yes! You can use the hotel's complimentary WiFi for video calls through apps like WhatsApp, Skype, or FaceTime. This would be free and often provides better quality than traditional phone calls. The WiFi password is in your welcome packet, or you can dial 9 to get it from the front desk.

user:
Excellent! I'll try that first. Thanks for the help!

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is expressing gratitude and seems satisfied with the information provided about international calling alternatives.

assistant channel=final:
You're welcome! Enjoy your call with your family, and don't hesitate to dial 9 if you need any other assistance during your stay.
