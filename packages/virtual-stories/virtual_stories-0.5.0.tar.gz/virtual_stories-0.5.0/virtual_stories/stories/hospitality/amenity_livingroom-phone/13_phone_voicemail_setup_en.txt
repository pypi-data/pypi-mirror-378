Hi! To set up voicemail, dial *98 from the living room phone. Your default PIN is the last 4 digits of your room number, which would be 2502. Once you're in the voicemail system, you can press 4 to record a personal greeting and customize your settings. The system can store up to 20 messages of 3 minutes each.

Great! And how will I know if I have new messages?

The phone light will blink when you have new messages. To retrieve them, just dial *98 again, enter your PIN (2502), and press 1 to listen to new messages. You can press 7 after listening to delete messages you don't need.
