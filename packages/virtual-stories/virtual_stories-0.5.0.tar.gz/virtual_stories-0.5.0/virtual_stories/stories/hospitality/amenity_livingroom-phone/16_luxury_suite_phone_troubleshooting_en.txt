Hello, I'm in Royal Suite 4501. The living room phone seems to be having connectivity issues - I can't make any calls and the display is showing "No Service."

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is experiencing phone connectivity issues in the Royal Suite. As a VIP guest, she has access to immediate technical support and priority service. I should provide troubleshooting steps and arrange for technical support.

assistant channel=final:
I apologize for the inconvenience. For Royal Suite guests, we have immediate technical support available. Let me arrange for our VIP technical team to check the fiber optic connection and phone system in your suite. They'll be there within 5 minutes. In the meantime, you can use the emergency phone in your bedroom or contact us directly at ext. 4500 for immediate assistance.

The city views from this suite are absolutely breathtaking, especially at sunset.

The panoramic city views from the Royal Tower are indeed spectacular. The floor-to-ceiling windows provide an unobstructed view of the entire skyline, making sunset moments truly magical.

What's the VIP concierge extension again?

The system prompt states "7700 VIP Concierge" as one of the speed dial options.

The VIP concierge extension is 7700.

Do you have any recommendations for private dining experiences that can be arranged for special occasions with custom menus?

assistant channel=analysis:
The guest is asking for private dining recommendations with custom menus, which goes beyond the hotel's internal phone system and requires external dining service information not available in the system prompt.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I'll research private dining experiences with custom menu options for special occasions.
