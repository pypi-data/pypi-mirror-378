Hello! I'm in Zen Suite 1508 and I'm practicing meditation. The living room phone keeps interrupting my sessions with loud ringtones. Can you help me set it to a more peaceful mode?

Absolutely! Our Zen Suite phones are designed specifically for wellness and meditation practice. You can activate meditation mode by pressing the menu button and selecting "Wellness Settings." This will enable gentle ringtones, silent notifications, and meditation timer integration. The phone also has soft lighting integration that won't disturb your practice. Would you like me to arrange for our wellness concierge to come up and configure all the tranquility features?
