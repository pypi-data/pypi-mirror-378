Hi! A small box of chocolates for Lena Park should arrive today—can you refrigerate it for the evening?

Check arrival; if not yet, still pre-request cold storage.

Great timing—the box is here. I’ve labeled it and secured it in our banquet walk‑in for up to 12 hours. Just swing by when you’re ready, and we’ll bring it right out.
