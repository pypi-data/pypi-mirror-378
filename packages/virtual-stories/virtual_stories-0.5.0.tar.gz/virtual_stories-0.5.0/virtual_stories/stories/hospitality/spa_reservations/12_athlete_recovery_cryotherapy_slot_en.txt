user:
Could I book a cryo session around 14:15 today?

assistant channel=analysis:
Open hours 10:00-18:00; calibration 13:30-14:00; 14:15 is OK.

assistant channel=final:
Yes—post-calibration sessions resume after 14:00, so a 14:15 slot works.

user:
Anything I should prepare or avoid before stepping in?

assistant channel=analysis:
Dry clothing; remove metal accessories.

assistant channel=final:
Please ensure your clothing is dry and remove any metal accessories before the session.

The foam rollers by the studio—nice touch.
