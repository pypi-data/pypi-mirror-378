- Access: Thermal suite access included with any body treatment same day.

user:
If we book the salt scrub at 18:30, can we still use the sauna and steam afterward?

assistant channel=analysis:
Access included same day with body treatment; hours to 20:00; last scrub 19:15, so 18:30 works.

assistant channel=final:
Yes. A 18:30 salt scrub qualifies you for thermal suite access the same evening, and the facilities are open until 20:00.

user:
Do you offer any refreshments in the lounge?

assistant channel=analysis:
Citrus water and seasonal fruit.

assistant channel=final:
We offer citrus water and seasonal fruit in the relaxation lounge.

user:
Sounds like a plan—nice way to end the day.

assistant channel=analysis:
Chitchat acknowledgement.

assistant channel=final:
It’s a calm way to unwind before the evening.

user:
Can you apply a specific imported sea salt blend we bring from home?

assistant channel=analysis:
Guest-provided product beyond context; special flag.

assistant channel=final:
[ATTENTION] I’m checking on approval for using your personal sea salt blend during the service.
