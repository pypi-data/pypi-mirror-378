The directory structure of the virtual stories is as follows: `virtual_stories/stories/{DOMAIN}/{TOPIC}/{SEQ_NUM}_{DIALOGUE_NAME}_{LANGUAGE_CODE}.txt`

- `{DOMAIN}`: The business domain or industry category, such as "entertainment_platform", "fitness_center", "public_utilities", "e_commerce", "healthcare", "automotive", "financial_services", "telecommunications", "education", "travel_aviation", etc (regex: `^[a-z_]+$`).
- `{TOPIC}`: The type of customer service interaction, such as "product_inquiry", "technical_support", "order_issues", "complaints_resolution", "billing_payment", "after_sales_service", "appointment_scheduling", "loyalty_programs", "emergency_support", "feedback_suggestions" (regex: `^[a-z_]+$`).
- `{SEQ_NUM}`: A unique sequential number for each dialogue within a topic, starting from 1 without zero-padding (e.g., 1, 2, 3, not 01, 02, 03).
- `{DIALOGUE_NAME}`: A brief, descriptive name for the dialogue that follows Python variable naming conventions (lowercase with underscores, no special characters or spaces. regex: `^[0-9a-z_]+$`).
- `{LANGUAGE_CODE}`: The ISO language code in lowercase with hyphens replaced by underscores, consisting only of lowercase letters and underscores (regex: `^[a-z_]+$`). Examples: "zh_cn", "en", "ja", "fr_ca".

user:
User say something. For example, "What's the weather like in Boston?"

assistant channel=analysis:
# If the channel is `analysis`, that means the assistant is analyzing, thinking and reasoning about the user's message. Content example:
The user is asking for the weather in Boston. I should use the `get_current_weather` tool. I will default to celsius since no unit was specified.

assistant channel=commentary to=tool.get_current_weather:
# The tool is called `get_current_weather`. The tool call must be in channel `commentary`. For example:
{"location": "Boston, MA", "unit": "celsius"}

tool.get_current_weather channel=commentary to=assistant:
The tool output is returned to the assistant in channel `commentary`. For example:
{"temperature": "22", "unit": "celsius", "description": "Partly cloudy"}

assistant channel=analysis:
The tool provided the weather data for Boston: 22 degrees Celsius and partly cloudy. I will now format this into a clear, concise sentence for the user.

assistant channel=final:
The current weather in Boston is 22¬∞C and partly cloudy. üå§Ô∏è
```

## Format Guidelines

- The docstring at the top must define:
    - ROLES: succinct user/assistant descriptions
    - CHANNELS: exactly one of `analysis`, `commentary`, `final` per assistant message
    - TOOLS: a JSON code block with an array of tool definitions following the Python OpenAI SDK `FunctionDefinition` shape. The `parameters` object uses OpenAPI JSON Schema.
- Tool calls occur only in `assistant channel=commentary` lines, using JSON on the next line.
- Tool results are emitted as `tool.<name> channel=commentary to=assistant:` followed by a single-line JSON object.
- Use `assistant channel=analysis` for private reasoning and planning. Keep it concise.
- Use `assistant channel=final` for the user-facing reply only.
- Special flag `[ATTENTION]`: Aka "I don't know". Used when available tools or system knowledge cannot adequately address the user's question. Simply acknowledge the inquiry and indicate we will search for more information - do not promise solutions, transfers, or specific actions.
    - **Definition:** This flag signals neutral processing only. It may involve background handoff, without implying acceptance, transfer completion, or resolution.
    - **When to use:** No suitable tools available, tool outputs insufficient, or system knowledge inadequate
    - **Response format:** Brief acknowledgment + neutral processing statement. Avoid uncertain promises.
    - **Requirements:** Begin response with the flag `[ATTENTION]` - no promises or commitments
    - **Placement:** The flag must be the first token at the very beginning of the final response line, followed by a single space. Do not place any text before it.
    - **Length and tone:** Up to 2 sentences; neutral wording; avoid affective words (e.g., "sorry", "unfortunately").
    - **Language:** Mirror the user's language; if unclear, default to English.
    - **Allowed processing statements (whitelist):** "I'm looking into this.", "Searching for more information.", "Reviewing available resources.", "Checking available options.", or similar. Diversity is required.
    - **Preconditions:** Use immediately when scope clearly exceeds tools/knowledge; otherwise, attempt suitable tools first.
    - **Forbidden:** Uncertain or promissory phrasing (e.g., "I don't ‚Ä¶", "forward to the relevant department ‚Ä¶", "Accept ‚Ä¶", "Arranging schedule ‚Ä¶", "Recorded and transferred ‚Ä¶", "will/going to/we'll/I'll/get back to you"). Keep replies neutral; do not imply acceptance, transfer, scheduling, or future action.
- Below are processing statements with similar meanings. Mix and match these examples or create your own variations to maintain natural, varied communication:
    - **Information Gathering:**
        - "Let me research this for you."
        - "I'll investigate this matter."
        - "Looking up the latest information."
        - "Gathering relevant data."
        - "Collecting information on this topic."
        - "Researching available details."
    - **Analysis & Review:**
        - "Analyzing the situation."
        - "Examining the possibilities."
        - "Assessing the available data."
        - "Evaluating potential solutions."
        - "Reviewing the documentation."
        - "Processing your request."
    - **Exploration & Investigation:**
        - "Exploring different approaches."
        - "Investigating potential answers."
        - "Digging into this question."
        - "Looking deeper into this issue."
        - "Examining various angles."
        - "Researching comprehensive solutions."
    - **Status Updates:**
        - "Working on your request."
        - "Retrieving information."
        - "Accessing relevant resources."
        - "Compiling available data."
        - "Cross-referencing sources."
        - "Verifying information."
