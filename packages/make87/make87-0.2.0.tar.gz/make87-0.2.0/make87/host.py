    This function checks if the host system client or other applications are
    running an update by looking for the presence of the update signal file.

        True if the host is updating, False otherwise.

    Note:
        This function checks for the existence of `/run/signal/updating` file.
        If the file exists, it indicates that an update is in progress.

        >>> if make87.host.host_is_updating():
        ...     print("Host is updating, waiting...")
