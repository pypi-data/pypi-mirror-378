"""make87 Python SDK.

This package provides a comprehensive SDK for building applications on the make87 platform.
It includes modules for configuration management, peripheral control, messaging interfaces,
data encoding/decoding, storage operations, and host system integration.

Modules:
    config: Configuration loading and management utilities
    peripherals: Hardware peripheral control and management
    models: Data models and type definitions
    encodings: Data serialization and encoding utilities
    interfaces: Messaging and communication interfaces
    storage: Blob storage operations and utilities
    host: Host system integration utilities

    """Run the application forever until a termination signal is received.

    This function sets up signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and blocks
    execution until one of these signals is received. This is typically used as the
    main loop for long-running make87 applications.

    The function will gracefully handle:
        - SIGTERM: Termination signal (sent by process managers)
        - SIGINT: Interrupt signal (Ctrl+C from terminal)

    Note:
        This is a blocking function that will run indefinitely until a signal
        is received. Make sure to set up all your application components before
        calling this function.

    Example:
        >>> import make87
        >>> # Set up your application components here
        >>> make87.run_forever()  # Blocks until signal received
