Holy smokes this is complicated

Keep this exporter in Alpha/Beta for a while
Add some text in the readme or somewhere:
    - No guarantees of correctness! This is always true with open source software,
      but even more here!
      Be sure to do your own validation before using this in production.
    - Alpha means the implementation may change drastically!
      Unlike official sem-ver, I am not making any guarantees on compatibility
    - I need your help! Validating, finding edge cases, etc...
