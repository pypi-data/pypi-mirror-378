Resets
================================================================================
use whatever is defined in RDL based on cpuif_reset and field_reset signals
Otherwise, provide configuration that defines what the default is:
    a single reset that is active high/low, or sync/async

If cpuif_reset is specified, what do fields use?
    I assume they still use the default reset separately?
    YES. Agnisys appears to be wrong.
    cpuif_reset has no influence on the fields' reset according to the spec
