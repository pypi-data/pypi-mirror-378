1. **Mark Transactions as Cleared**
   Navigate through your uncleared transactions and mark them as cleared with a single keypress.

2. **Clean Up Journal**
   Automatically clean and format your journal file. The tool will ensure your journal is valid before making any changes.

## ⚙️ Configuration

**hhelper** requires a `config.toml` file located at `~/.config/hhelper/config.toml`. This file should define the paths to your ledger, price, header, and recurring transaction files. Here's an example configuration:

```toml
[paths]
directory = "~/finance"
ledger_file = "journal.ledger"
price_file = "prices.ledger"
header_file = "header.ledger"
recurring_tx_file = "recurring.ledger"

[commodities]
commodity_pairs = [
    { symbol = "AAPL", base_currency = "USD", quote_currency = "AAPL", is_append_space = true },
    { symbol = "BTC-USD", base_currency = "USD", quote_currency = "BTC", is_append_space = false },
]
```
