GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2025 ASWIN KUMAR K

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,
you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is
no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL
requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program
non-free.  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.

“Convey” means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive
copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of
a copy, is not conveying.

“Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

“A Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for
a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working
in that language.

“Corresponding Source” for a work in object code or executable form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code or executable, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does
not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes
interface definition files associated with source files for header files, and
source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control
flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

1. Source Code.

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for
a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working
in that language.

2. Basic Permissions.

You may:

  a) Copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes,
     without asking permission.

  b) Copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes,
     without asking permission.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological protection measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
Treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
circumvention of such protection.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and
any conditions added to the Program are part of the Program; and keep intact all notices
stating that this License and any conditions added to the Program are part of the Program.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from
the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that
you meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified work must be marked as changed, so that its status as a modified
     version will be clear, and if it has been modified, you must include an appropriate
     copyright notice.

  b) You must license the modified work under this License.

  c) You must keep intact all notices stating that this License and any conditions
     added to the Program are part of the Program; and keep intact all notices stating
     that this License and any conditions added to the Program are part of the Program.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from
the Program, in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 4 and 5,
provided that you also do one of the following:

  a) Convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
     in one of these ways:

    1) Convey the Corresponding Source under this License, in a medium customarily
       used for software interchange; or,

    2) Accompany the object code or executable with a written offer, valid for at least
       three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
       physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
       Corresponding Source; or,

    3) Accompany the object code or executable with the information you received as to
       the offer to distribute the Corresponding Source.

  b) Convey the object code or executable under the terms of this License, and include
     a copy of this License along with the object code or executable.

7. Additional Terms.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted by
this License.

8. Termination.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted by
this License.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the
Program.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this
License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
License.

11. Patents.

A contributor to the Program may choose to grant a patent license to the Program,
under the terms of this License.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted by
this License.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Not all software licenses are compatible with the GNU General Public License.
If you intend to use this software with the GNU Affero General Public License,
you must ensure that the software is compatible with that license.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library as you received
it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
“or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU
Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

There is no warranty for the Program, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holders and/or other parties
provide the Program “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness
for a particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
Program is with you.  Should the Program prove defective, you assume the cost of all
necessary servicing, repair or correction.

16. Limitation of Liability.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any
copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or distribute the Program
as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the
Program (including but not limited to loss of
