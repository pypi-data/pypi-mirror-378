"""
City2Graph: A comprehensive package for constructing graphs from geospatial datasets.

This package provides tools for converting geospatial data into graph representations
suitable for network analysis and graph neural networks. It supports various graph
types including proximity-based, morphological, and transportation networks.

Notes
-----
Main modules include:
- data : Loading and processing geospatial data from sources like Overture Maps
- graph : Converting between GeoDataFrames and PyTorch Geometric objects
- morphology : Creating morphological graphs from urban data
- proximity : Generating proximity-based graph networks
- transportation : Processing GTFS data and creating transportation networks
- utils : Core utilities for graph conversion and validation
