    """
    Draw filled bounding boxes with opacity on detected objects.
    
    Creates semi-transparent filled rectangles for clean overlays that enhance object visibility
    without obscuring underlying image details. Automatically adapts opacity based on image 
    dimensions for optimal visibility and uses alpha blending for professional-quality results.
    
    Args:
        image (np.ndarray): Input image to draw filled boxes on in BGR color format.
                           Expected shape: (height, width, 3) with uint8 values [0, 255].
        detections (Detections): Detections object containing bounding boxes.
                               Each detection must have a 'bbox' attribute with (x1, y1, x2, y2) 
                               coordinates in pixel units. Coordinates are automatically clipped 
                               to image boundaries.
        opacity (Optional[float]): Fill opacity for bounding boxes.
                                 Range: [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is fully transparent and 1.0 is opaque.
                                 Values outside this range are automatically clamped.
                                 If None, automatically calculated based on image size (typically 0.3-0.5).
        colors (Optional[List[tuple]]): List of BGR color tuples to override default colors.
                                      Each tuple should contain (B, G, R) values in range [0, 255].
                                      Colors are mapped to unique class_ids in order of appearance.
                                      If None, uses default ColorManager colors based on class_id.
    
    Returns:
        np.ndarray: Image with filled bounding boxes drawn. The input image is modified in-place
                   and returned for convenience. Same shape and dtype as input image.
    
    Raises:
        AttributeError: If detections object doesn't have required 'bbox' attribute for any detection.
        IndexError: If bbox coordinates are malformed or contain insufficient values.
        ValueError: If image array is not 3-dimensional or has invalid shape.
        TypeError: If colors parameter contains non-tuple elements or invalid color values.
        
    Example:
        >>> import cv2
        >>> import pixelflow as pf
        >>> from ultralytics import YOLO
        >>> 
        >>> # Load image and get model predictions
        >>> image = cv2.imread("people.jpg")
        >>> model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
        >>> outputs = model.predict(image)  # Raw YOLO outputs
        >>> detections = pf.results.from_ultralytics(outputs)  # Convert to PixelFlow format
        >>> 
        >>> # Draw filled boxes with automatic opacity (recommended for most cases)
        >>> annotated = pf.annotate.filled_box(image, detections)
        >>> 
        >>> # Use custom opacity for subtle overlay effect
        >>> annotated = pf.annotate.filled_box(image, detections, opacity=0.25)
        >>> 
        >>> # Override with custom colors for specific visualization needs
        >>> custom_colors = [(255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0), (0, 0, 255)]  # Blue, Green, Red
        >>> annotated = pf.annotate.filled_box(image, detections, opacity=0.4, colors=custom_colors)
        >>> 
        >>> # High opacity for maximum emphasis in presentations
        >>> annotated = pf.annotate.filled_box(image, detections, opacity=0.8)
    
    Notes:
        - Input image is modified in-place using alpha blending for memory efficiency
        - Opacity is automatically calculated using square-root scaling based on image area
        - Auto-calculated opacity decreases slightly for larger images to prevent visual clutter
        - Typical auto-calculated opacity ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 for optimal visibility
        - Uses cv2.addWeighted() for smooth alpha blending without artifacts
        - Multiple overlapping boxes create cumulative opacity effects
        - Bounding box coordinates are automatically converted to integers and clipped to image bounds
        - Color selection follows class_id-based mapping for consistent visualization across frames
        
    Performance Notes:
        - Creates temporary overlay image for each bounding box for proper alpha blending
        - Memory usage scales linearly with number of detections
        - Processing time is O(n) where n is the number of detections
        - Alpha blending adds ~20% overhead compared to simple rectangle drawing
