    Demonstration of a task to sample a subset of orientations from a CTF file using MTEX,
    and produce pole figures of the sampled orientations.
  - >
    Note that `sample_orientations` schemas pick a random subset of orientations from the
    EBSD data, whereas the `sample_texture` schemas first construct an orientation
    distribution function (ODF), from which orientations are then sampled.
