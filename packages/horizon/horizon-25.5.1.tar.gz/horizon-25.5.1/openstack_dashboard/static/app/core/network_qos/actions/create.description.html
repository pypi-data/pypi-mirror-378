  <dd translate>QoS is defined as the ability to guarantee certain network requirements like bandwidth, latency, jitter,
and reliability in order to satisfy a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between an application provider and end users.</dd>

  <dd translate>Network devices such as switches and routers can mark traffic so that it is handled with a higher priority to fulfill the QoS conditions agreed under the SLA.
In other cases, certain network traffic such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and video streaming needs to be transmitted with minimal bandwidth constraints.
On a system without network QoS management, all traffic will be transmitted in a “best-effort” manner making it impossible to guarantee service delivery to customers.</dd>
