    With this release, Horizon uses only the Block Storage API v3.
    Horizon has been using the Block Storage API v3 by default since
    Queens, so this change should not impact Horizon functionality.
    (The Block Storage API v2 was deprecated by the Cinder project
    in the Pike release, and is scheduled to be removed in the Xena
    release.)
