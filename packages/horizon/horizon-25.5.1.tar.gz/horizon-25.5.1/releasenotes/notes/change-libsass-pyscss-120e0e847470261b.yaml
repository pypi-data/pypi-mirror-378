prelude: >
    Horizon is switching away from pyscss and django-pyscss, and now uses the
    libsass library for partsing the scss files instead.
upgrade:
  - |
    Horizon now uses the libsass library. Horizon packagers now need to include
    python3-libsass in the dependency list.
deprecations:
  - |
    Horizon no longer uses the pyscss and django-pyscss libraries. They can be
    safely removed from the dependency lists by Horizon packagers.
