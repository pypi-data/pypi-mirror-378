    Default cache backend has been changed from MemcachedCache backend to
    PyMemcacheCache backend. MemcachedCache backend was deprecated in django
    3.2 and was later removed in django 4.1. Note that the LOCATION option
    needs to be updated in case memcached servers use IPv6, so that inet6
    prefix is not included.
