    Horizon no longer requires the keystone admin endpoint. keystone does
    not distinguish public and admin endpoints and there is no functional
    difference between public and admin endpoints. There is no need for
    a separate endpoint for keystone admin operations, but horizon required
    the keystone admin endpoint is configured previously. This requirement
    no longer exists. An endpoint specified by ``OPENSTACK_ENDPOINT_TYPE``
    setting is used for the keystone admin operations. You can drop
    the admin endpoint for keystone (unless other services require it).
