    Added a new setting ``OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_ENDPOINT_TYPE`` that can be used to
    specify the endpoint type to use when talking to the identity API.
    By default, ``OPENSTACK_ENDPOINT_TYPE`` is still referred for the identity
    API, If you would like to use a different endpoint for the identity API,
    you can use this setting.
