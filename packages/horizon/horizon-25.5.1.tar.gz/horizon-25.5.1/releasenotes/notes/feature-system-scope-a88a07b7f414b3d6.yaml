    Horizon can now use a system scope token when performing admin operations.
    To enable that, a new setting, SYSTEM_SCOPE_SERVICES, has to list the
    OpenStack services for which this feature is to be enabled. When that
    setting is not empty, a new option, "system scope" will appear in the
    context switching menu, and the panels for the listed services will be
    moved into that context in the main menu.
