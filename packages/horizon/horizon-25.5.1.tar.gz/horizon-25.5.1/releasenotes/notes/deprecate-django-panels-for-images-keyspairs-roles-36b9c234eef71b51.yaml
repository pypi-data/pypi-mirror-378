deprecations:
  - |
    The Django version of the Images, Keypairs, and Roles panels
    is deprecated now. Switch to the AngularJS version by setting
    ``images_panel``, ``key_pairs_panel`` and ``roles_panel`` keys
    in ``ANGULAR_FEATURES`` setting to ``True``
    (or dropping these keys from ``ANGULAR_FEATURES`` setting).
    The horizon team believes that feature gaps between Django and
    AngularJS implementations have been closed for all these panels and
    we can drop the Django version. If you see any feature gap, please
    file a bug to horizon or contact the horizon team.
