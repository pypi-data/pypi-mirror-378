    [:bug:`1874705`] Add a new variable WEBSSO_USE_HTTP_REFERER to
    facilitate WEBSSO deployments where network segmentation is used per
    security requirement. In this case, the controllers cannot reach
    other services external endpoints. Therefore, using the
    HTTP_REFERER to derive the Keystone endpoint in the websso view will
    return a timeout for requests to Keystone in cases where the external
    Keystone endpoint is the HTTP_REFERER.
    WEBSSO_USE_HTTP_REFERER defaults to True to keep inline with current
    functionality. When set to False the OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL is used
    instead of the HTTP_REFERER. If OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL is set to the
    internal Keystone endpoint the requests between Horizon and Keystone
    should be able to connect.
