[CDF-25693] Fixing default config path (#1945)

# Description

When loading modules, the path to default configuration was hardcoded to
builtin modules, so the generated config.<env>.yaml files were populated
with the wrong content. This is now fixed.

## Changelog

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Skip

### Fixed

relevant modules.
