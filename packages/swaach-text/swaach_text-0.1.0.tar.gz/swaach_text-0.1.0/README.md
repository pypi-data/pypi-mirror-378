# swaach-text

A small, dependency-light toolkit for **Hinglish + social text cleaning**:
- Emoji â†’ text tags (e.g., `ðŸ˜‚ â†’ [laughing]`)
- Accent/diacritics removal (`cafÃ© â†’ cafe`)
- Hashtag splitter (`#ThisIsGreat â†’ This Is Great`)
- Hinglish shorthand expansion + filler removal
- Optional PII redaction

## Install
```bash
pip install swaach-text
```

## Quick use
```python
from swaach_text import normalize, Cleaner

print(normalize("Plz yaar tmrw call me ðŸ˜‚ at cafÃ© #ThisIsGreat!!!"))
# -> "please tomorrow call me [laughing] at cafe This Is Great!"
```

### CLI
```bash
swaach-text "Plz tmrw call me ðŸ˜‚ at cafÃ© #ThisIsGreat"
# please tomorrow call me [laughing] at cafe This Is Great
```
