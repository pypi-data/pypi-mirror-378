Most functions have examples in docstrings.

Converting scanimage tiffs into intermediate filetypes for preprocessing or to use with Suite2p is covered [here](https://millerbrainobservatory.github.io/mbo_utilities/assembly.html).

Function examples [here](https://millerbrainobservatory.github.io/mbo_utilities/api/usage.html) are a work in progress.
