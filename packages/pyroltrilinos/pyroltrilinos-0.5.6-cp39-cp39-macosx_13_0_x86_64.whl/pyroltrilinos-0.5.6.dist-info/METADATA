pyrol
=====

pyrol is a wrapper for the Trilinos
[ROL](https://trilinos.github.io/rol) library using
[pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). It also supports
serialisation of in-progress optimisation using [cereal](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal).

Installation
------------

pyrol will build a compatible version of the Trilinos shared library
as part of its build process. For this, a C++ compiler, CMake, BLAS
and LAPACK implementations are all required. With these components in
place, installation should be as simple as `pip install`. For more
complicated environments, CMake arguments can be provided through the
`CMAKE_ARGS` environment variable.
