This module is intended for allowing users to use OCA's Knowledge app
for as a source of knowledge for AI Agents, although this is not the
only usage this module could have

Configuration
=============

Configuration Guide
-------------------

To use this module as intended, two components must be configured:

1. **Bridge configuration on the Odoo side**
2. **An endpoint capable of handling bridge requests**

For an agent to have updated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
capabilities, you must create at least **three bridges** for each active
knowledge database:

- | **Bridge with ``Usage = "AI Thread Create"``**
  | Adds document pages to the external database used by agents.

- | **Bridge with ``Usage = "AI Thread Write"``**
  | Updates document pages already on the external database used by
    agents.

- | **Bridge with ``Usage = "AI Thread Unlink"``**
  | Removes document pages from the external database when those pages
    are deleted from Odoo.

For creating those bridges, apart from the usage of the bridge, the user
must define:

- Payload Type: it depends on the endpoint configuration, normally
  "Record" would work.
- Result Type: for this case "No processing" is OK.
- Model: select the "Document Page" model
- Field: add at least the fields the endpoint is expecting on the other
  side.
- Filter: add a domain for using the bridge only with the documents
  intended to trigger bridge

For context, you can download an `example n8n workflow JSON
file <../static/description/RagCapabilitiesWithOdooKnowledge.json>`__
capable of handling the bridge with ``Usage = "AI Thread Create"``. This
workflow includes a manual trigger for testing purposes. Remember to
update the models and database knowledge as needed.

Usage
=====

Depending on the bridges you have created, create, update or delete a
Document Page mathing the bridge domain. You should see the execution on
the AI Bridge Execution menu.

For testing the endpoint side, you can download `this n8n workflow
JSON <../static/description/RagCapabilitiesWithOdooKnowledge.json>`__,
capable of inserting information on the database. Keep in mind that for
this to work at least ``content``, ``display_name`` and ``draft_name``
fields should be included on the list of fields
