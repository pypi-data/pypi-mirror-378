# `pipeline-eds`

`pipeline-eds` is a Python project designed to simplify API access to Emerson Enterprise Data Server (EDS) machines. It facilitates seamless data exchange between Emerson's Ovation local systems and various external parties, including third-party contractors and internal employees. The project is distributed on PyPI under the package name `pipeline-eds`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This section provides a quick guide to help you get `pipeline` up and running. Choose the setup method that best suits your needs: CLI-only usage or local development.

### üíª CLI Installation (Recommended for End-Users)

For a simple command-line interface (CLI) experience, **`pipx`** is the recommended installation method. `pipx` installs and runs Python applications in isolated environments, preventing conflicts with your system's Python packages.

1.  **Install `pipx`**
    If you don't have `pipx` installed, you can get it with `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip install pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    ```
2.  **Install `pipeline-eds` with `pipx`**
    Install the package directly from PyPI. If you need Windows-specific dependencies like `pyodbc` and `matplotlib`, use the `[windows]` extra.
    ```bash
    pipx install pipeline-eds
    # For Windows users:
    pipx install "pipeline-eds[windows]"
    ```
3.  **Run CLI Commands**
    The `pyproject.toml` file defines `pipeline`, `eds`, and `pipeline-eds` as command-line aliases. Once installed, you can use any of these aliases directly from your terminal.
    ```bash
    pipeline configure
    eds check
    pipeline-eds trend M100FI -s June3 -f June17
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer & Contributor Setup

If you plan to contribute to the project or need to work with the source code, follow these steps to set up a full development environment.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Start by cloning the project from GitHub and navigating into the directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/pipeline.git
    cd pipeline
    ```
2.  **Install `pyenv` and `Poetry`**
    This project uses **`pyenv`** for managing Python versions and **`Poetry`** for dependency management. This combination ensures a clean, reproducible development environment without interfering with your system's Python installation.
      * **Install `pyenv`:** Refer to the official `pyenv` documentation for your operating system ([pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) for Windows, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Linux/macOS).
      * **Install `Poetry`:** See the [Poetry documentation](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://python-poetry.org/docs/%23installation) for installation instructions.
3.  **Configure the Environment**
    Use `pyenv` to set the Python version for the project and then tell Poetry to use that version:
    ```bash
    pyenv install 3.11.9
    pyenv local 3.11.9
    poetry env use 3.11.9
    ```
4.  **Install Dependencies**
    Poetry will read the `pyproject.toml` file and install all necessary packages into a new virtual environment:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
5.  **Run Development Commands**
    Once installed, you can execute commands using `poetry run`:
    ```bash
    poetry run python -m pipeline.env
    poetry run eds ping
    ```
    This ensures that all commands run within the project's isolated environment.

## üîê Security & Configuration

`pipeline` uses a two-tiered approach to manage configuration and secrets.

  * **Non-Sensitive Configuration**: Non-sensitive settings like URLs and paths are stored in a local JSON file (`~/.pipeline-eds/config.json`). This file is easy to inspect and manage.
  * **Secrets and Credentials**: For CLI users, API credentials and passwords are **securely stored** using your operating system's native keyring. This is a much safer alternative to storing plaintext passwords in a file. The `pipeline configure` command guides you through this one-time setup process.

**Note for Developers**: While the CLI now uses the keyring, some functionality within the codebase still relies on the `secrets.yaml` file for credential management. This file is not required for general CLI usage but may be necessary for specific development workflows and legacy components.

**Important**: You must be on the same network as your server (e.g., via a VPN) if it is not publicly accessible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Implementation & Use Cases

`pipeline` is designed to be deployed as a scheduled task on a Windows server.

  * The project is executed by **Windows Task Scheduler**, which calls a PowerShell script (`main_eds_to_rjn_quiet.ps1`) as the entry point.
  * The iterative timing (e.g., hourly execution) is handled by the `Task Scheduler`, not by Python.
  * For these automated tasks, a standard `venv` is used, as `Task Scheduler` can run under different user accounts.

## üì± Running on Android (`Termux`)

The `pipeline` project can be installed and run on Android devices using the **Termux** terminal emulator. **CLI installation via `pipx` is the recommended method for Termux users, as development is not expected in this environment.**

### Termux Limitations

  * **No `pyenv` or `Poetry`**: Package management must be done with `pip` directly.
  * **Limited Library Support**: Some libraries that require compilation (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`) or have GUI dependencies are not supported on Termux.
  * **HTML Viewer**: You may need to manually configure the default `HTML` viewer to a full-featured browser on Android.
  
### üìù Final Note on Naming
The project is internally referred to as pipeline, but the PyPI package is named pipeline-eds to avoid a name conflict with an existing, unrelated package on PyPI. For CLI usage, the pyproject.toml file creates aliases so you can use pipeline, eds, and pipeline-eds interchangeably in your terminal. This allows for a more intuitive command-line experience without the need to use the full PyPI package name.
