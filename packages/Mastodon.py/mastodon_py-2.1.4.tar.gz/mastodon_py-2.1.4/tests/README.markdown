## Running

To run this test suite, install the testing dependencies:

    pip install -e .[test,webpush,blurhash]

Then, run `pytest`.

If you wish to check test coverage:

    pytest --cov=mastodon

And if you want a complete HTML coverage report:

    pytest --cov=mastodon --cov-report html:coverage
    # then open coverage/index.html in your favourite web browser

Note that some tests are slightly unstable, as they require sidekiq to do things at the right time, and will thus sometimes break.

## Contributing

[VCR.py]: https://vcrpy.readthedocs.io/

This test suite uses [VCR.py][] to record requests to Mastodon and replay them in successive runs.

If you want to add or change tests, you will need a Mastodon development server running on `http://localhost:3000`.
To set this up, follow the development guide at https://docs.joinmastodon.org/dev/setup/ .

It also needs various things to be set up for it. The following command will do the trick:

    sudo redis-cli flushall && sleep 3 && \
    sudo /etc/init.d/redis-server restart && \
    RAILS_ENV=development rails db:setup && \
    RAILS_ENV=development bin/tootctl accounts create admin2 --email zerocool@example.com --confirmed --role Owner && \
    RAILS_ENV=development bin/tootctl accounts create mastodonpy_test --email mastodonpy_test@localhost:3000 --confirmed && \
    RAILS_ENV=development bin/tootctl accounts create mastodonpy_test_2 --email mastodonpy_test_2@localhost:3000 --confirmed && \
    psql -d mastodon_development < ~/masto/Mastodon.py/tests/setup.sql && sleep 4 && \
    RAILS_ENV=development DB_PASS="" foreman start

You _may_ additionally have to set up a database password and pass it as DB_PASS for the streaming tests to function.

Tests that send requests to Mastodon should be marked as needing VCR with the `pytest.mark.vcr` decorator. Streaming tests use a
heavily monkeypatched version of VCR.py to work and may behave in weird ways sometimes.

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.vcr()
def test_fun_new_feature(api):
    foo = api.fun_new_feature()
    assert foo = "bar"
```
