This module is useful when you generate payment/debit orders with
several payments and your company's bank groups the debit/credit on a
single bank statement line (in fact, one bank statement line per payment
lot). This module makes it easier to reconcile payment/debit lots in the
bank statement reconcile interface.

In the bank statement reconcile interface, you will see an additional
tab **Payment Lots** if the statement line is negative or **Debit Lots**
if the statement line is positive. If the bank statement line
corresponds to a payment lot, select it in the *Payment Lots* tab and
all the counterpart journal items will be automatically set.

|Bank statement reconcile interface|

This solution works both when *Outstanding Payments/Receipts Accounts*
are configured and when there are no *Outstanding Payment/Receipt
Account*.
