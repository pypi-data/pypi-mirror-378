This module is useful when you generate payment/debit orders with several payments and your company's bank groups the debit/credit on a single bank statement line (in fact, one bank statement line per payment lot). This module makes it easier to reconcile payment/debit lots in the bank statement reconcile interface.

In the bank statement reconcile interface, you will see an additional tab **Payment Lots** if the statement line is negative or **Debit Lots** if the statement line is positive. If the bank statement line corresponds to a payment lot, select it in the *Payment Lots* tab and all the counterpart journal items will be automatically set.

This solution works both when *Outstanding Payments/Receipts Accounts* are configured and when there are no *Outstanding Payment/Receipt Account*.
