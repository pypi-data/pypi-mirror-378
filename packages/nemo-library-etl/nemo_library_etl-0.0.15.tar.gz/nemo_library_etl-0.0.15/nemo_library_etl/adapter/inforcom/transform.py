"""
InforCOM ETL Transform Module.

This module handles the transformation phase of the InforCOM ETL pipeline.
It processes the extracted data, applies business rules, data cleaning, and formatting
to prepare the data for loading into the target system.

The transformation process typically includes:
1. Data validation and quality checks
2. Data type conversions and formatting
3. Business rule application
4. Data enrichment and calculated fields
5. Data structure normalization
6. Comprehensive logging throughout the process

Classes:
    InforCOMTransform: Main class handling InforCOM data transformation.

    The transformer:
    - Uses NemoLibrary for core functionality and configuration

        This method orchestrates the complete transformation process by:
        1. Loading extracted data from the previous ETL phase
        2. Applying data validation and quality checks
        3. Performing data type conversions and formatting
        4. Applying business rules and logic
