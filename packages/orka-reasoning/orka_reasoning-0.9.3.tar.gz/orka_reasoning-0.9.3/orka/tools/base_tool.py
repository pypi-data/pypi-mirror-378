"""
Base Tool Module
===============

This module defines the abstract base class for all tools in the OrKa framework.
It establishes the core contract that all tool implementations must follow,
ensuring consistent behavior and interoperability within orchestrated workflows.

The BaseTool class provides:
- Common initialization parameters shared by all tools
- Abstract interface definition through the run() method
- Type identification via the tool's class name
- String representation for debugging and logging
