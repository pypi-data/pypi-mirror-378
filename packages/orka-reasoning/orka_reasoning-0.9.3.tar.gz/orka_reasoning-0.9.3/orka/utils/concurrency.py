"""
Concurrency Module
=================

This module provides tools for managing asynchronous operations with controlled concurrency
and timeouts in the OrKa framework. It centralizes concurrency management to avoid resource
overuse and improve reliability.

Key components:
- ConcurrencyManager: Central class for controlling task concurrency and timeouts
- Semaphore-based limiting of concurrent operations
- Task tracking and graceful shutdown capabilities
- Decorator pattern for easy application to async functions

Usage example:
```python
# Create a manager with max 5 concurrent tasks
concurrency = ConcurrencyManager(max_concurrency=5)

# Option 1: Use the run_with_timeout method directly
result = await concurrency.run_with_timeout(my_async_function, timeout=10.0, arg1="value")

# Option 2: Use as a decorator
@concurrency.with_concurrency(timeout=5.0)
async def my_function(param):
    # Function will run with concurrency control and 5s timeout
    return await some_async_operation(param)

# Graceful shutdown when needed
await concurrency.shutdown()
```

    Manages concurrency and timeouts for async operations.

    This class provides a central mechanism to limit the number of concurrent tasks,

    resource exhaustion and improve reliability in async applications.
