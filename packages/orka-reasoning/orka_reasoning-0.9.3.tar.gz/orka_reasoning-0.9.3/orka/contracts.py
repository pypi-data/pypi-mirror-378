"""
Type Contracts
=============

This module defines the core data structures and type contracts used throughout the
OrKa framework. These TypedDict classes establish a consistent interface for data
exchange between components, ensuring type safety and providing documentation on
the expected structure of data objects.

The contracts defined here serve several purposes:
1. Type checking and validation at development time
2. Documentation of data structure requirements
3. Standardization of interfaces between components
4. Support for IDE autocompletion and code navigation

These contracts are essential for maintaining a clean architecture and ensuring
that components can be composed reliably with predictable data formats.

    Core context passed to all nodes during execution.

    This is the primary data structure that flows through the OrKa pipeline,
    containing input data, accumulated outputs from previous nodes, and
    execution metadata.

    Attributes:
        input: The original query or input text to process
        previous_outputs: Results from previously executed nodes in the pipeline

    Standard output format for all nodes.

    Defines a consistent structure for node execution results, including
    success/failure status and relevant metadata.
