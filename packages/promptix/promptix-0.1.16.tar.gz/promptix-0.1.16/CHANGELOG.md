- Dual-format confusion by eliminating JSON/YAML mixed support
- Legacy JSON fallback mechanisms in Promptix Studio

### Fixed
- Version consistency: synchronized version 0.1.11 across `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`
- Storage format confusion by eliminating dual YAML/JSON support
- Configuration management with centralized, environment-aware settings
- Error messages now provide clear, actionable migration guidance

### Migration Guide
**For users with existing `prompts.json` files:**

1. **Rename your file**: `mv prompts.json prompts.yaml`
2. **Verify YAML syntax**: Ensure your content follows proper YAML format
3. **Test your setup**: Run your application to verify the migration worked
