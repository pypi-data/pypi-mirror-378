Welcome to sl-suite2p API documentation page
============================================

sl-suite2p is an enhanced suite2p implementation that includes a pipeline to track cell activity across sessions (days).

This library is developed in the `Sun lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University. It is an
extension of the original `suite2p <https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p>`_ library that features a new pipeline,
optimized source code, improved documentation and more flexible API and CLI architectures. At this time, it is fully
compatible and interchangeable with the original suite2p library.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this library. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions and library usage examples:
`sl-suite2p GitHub repository <https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/suite2p>`_.

Note! Currently, the work on converting the suite2p to the latest Sun lab documentation standards is still ongoing and
a large portion of the original source code remains undocumented. Future incremental patches will iteratively add
documentation for the entire original (single-day) pipeline codebase, while also optimizing the source code where
necessary.
