Executive Summary
-----------------



 A Russian threat actor we track as
 [Fighting Ursa](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/fighting-ursa/) 
 advertised a car for sale as a lure to distribute
 [HeadLace](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.headlace) 
 backdoor malware.The campaign likely targeted diplomats and began as early as March 2024.Fighting Ursa (aka APT28, Fancy Bear and Sofacy) has been
 [associated with Russian military intelligence and classified as an advanced persistent threat (APT) [PDF]](https://strapi.eurepoc.eu/uploads/Eu_Repo_C_APT_profile_APT_28_4856c0a0ac.pdf) 
. 



 Diplomatic-car-for-sale phishing lure themes have been used by Russian threat actors for years.These lures tend to resonate with diplomats and get targets to click on the malicious content. 



 Unit 42 has previously observed other threat groups using this tactic.For example, in 2023, a different Russian threat group,
 [Cloaked Ursa](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloaked-ursa-phishing/) 
 , repurposed an advertisement for a BMW for sale to target diplomatic missions within Ukraine.This campaign is not directly connected to the Fighting Ursa campaign described here.However, the similarity in tactics points to known behaviors of Fighting Ursa.The Fighting Ursa group is known for repurposing successful tactics – even
 [continuously exploiting known vulnerabilities for 20 months](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/russian-apt-fighting-ursa-exploits-cve-2023-233397/) 
 after their cover was already blown. 



 The details of the March 2024 campaign, which we attribute to Fighting Ursa with a medium to high level of confidence, indicate the group targeted diplomats and relied on public and free services to host various stages of the attack.This article examines the infection chain from the attack. 



 Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed in this article through our
 [Network Security](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security) 
 solutions, such as
 [Advanced WildFire](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-wildfire)

 The
 [URL kicking off this infection chain](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/7721209735fc8e3d0ccd88bae7f7f37cfcc453288f82b85e57686192a8efd83f) 
 was hosted by a legitimate service named
 [Webhook.site](https://docs.webhook.site/) 
 , and it was submitted to VirusTotal on March 14, 2024.Webhook.site is a service for legitimate development projects, and it allows its users to create randomized URLs for various purposes like custom automation based on the characteristics of visitors to the URLs. 



 In this case, Fighting Ursa abused Webhook.site to craft a URL that returned
 [a malicious HTML page](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/cda936ecae566ab871e5c0303d8ff98796b1e3661885afd9d4690fc1e945640e)

 URL.

 Figure 1.HTML code used in the attack hosted on the Webhook.site service. 




 The HTML shown above in Figure 1 has multiple elements that attempt to automate the attack.First, it checks if the visiting computer is Windows-based.If not, it redirects to a decoy image on
 [a URL hosted by another legitimate provider](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/26df5d7ed6748ad3ea9e2e18db3e6535ef99cb4b1a0c46218f91db7626d3efd5) 
 , which is a free service named
 [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/upload) 
.As the final payload is Windows based, this operating system check is probably an effort to ensure that further actions taken in the attack are only taken for Windows visitors.The HTML then creates a ZIP archive from Base64 text in the HTML, offers it for download and attempts to open it with the JavaScript
 
 click()
 
 function. 



 Figure 2 below shows
 [the decoy image](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7c85ff89b535a39d47756dfce4597c239ee16df88badefe8f76051b836a7cbfb) 
 advertising a car for sale, specifically an Audi Q7 Quattro SUV.This fake advertisement is titled “Diplomatic Car For Sale.”
 



 The image provides different views of the vehicle.The image also contains contact details that are likely fake, as well as a phone number based in Romania.Finally, the image also lists the point of contact as the Southeast European Law Enforcement Center, possibly to lend this fake advertisement more credibility.

Downloaded Malware
------------------



 The downloaded ZIP archive is saved as
 [IMG-387470302099.zip](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/dad1a8869c950c2d1d322c8aed3757d3988ef4f06ba230b329c8d510d8d9a027)
 and contains three files listed below in Table 1. 




| **File Size** | **Modified Date and Time** | **File Name** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 918,528 bytes | 2009-07-13 18:38 UTC | IMG-387470302099.jpg.exe |

| 922 bytes | 2024-03-13 00:37 UTC | zqtxmo.bat |



 Table 1.Contents of the downloaded file
 
 IMG-387470302099.zip
 
. 



 Table 1 above shows that the first file
 
 IMG-387470302099.jpg.exe
 
 has a double file extension of
 
.jpg.exe
 
.Windows hosts with a default configuration hide file extensions, so the
 
.jpg.exe
 
 file extension only shows as
 
.jpg
 
 in the file name.This is a common tactic used by threat actors to trick potential victims into double-clicking the file, in this case believing it will open a car for sale advertisement. 



 The file named
 
 IMG-387470302099.jpg.exe
 
 is a copy of the legitimate Windows calculator file
 
 calc.exe
 
.This file is used to sideload the included DLL file
 
 WindowsCodecs.dll
 
 , which is a component of the
 [HeadLace](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.headlace) 
 backdoor. 



 HeadLace is modular malware that executes in stages.This stage-based loading is probably designed to prevent detection and minimize the malware's exposure to analysts.The DLL file contains a function shown below in Figure 3.

 Figure 4.Contents of the

 batch file. 




 This batch file starts a process for Microsoft Edge (
 
 start msedge
 
 ) to run content passed as Base64-encoded text.As shown above in Figure 4, the decoded text is a hidden iframe that retrieves content from
 [a different Webhook.site URL](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/844ac27e672a1fc6840a29b3c8443004b06469905b82dbbcf56dd5b53fea9484) 
. 



 The batch file saves content from this second Webhook.site URL as
 
 IMG387470302099.jpg
 
 in the user's downloads directory.It then moves the downloaded file into the
 
 %programdata%
 
 directory and changes the file extension from
 
.jpg
 
 to
 
.cmd
 
.Finally, the batch file executes
 
 IMG387470302099.cmd
 
 , then deletes itself as a way to remove any obvious trace of malicious activity. 


Attribution
-----------



 We attribute this activity with a medium to high level of confidence to Fighting Ursa based on the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), characteristics of the attack infrastructure and the malware family attackers used. 



 This attack relies heavily on public and free services to host lures and various stages of the attack.Documentation by
 [IBM](https://securityintelligence.com/x-force/itg05-ops-leverage-israel-hamas-conflict-lures-to-deliver-headlace-malware/) 
 ,
 [Proofpoint](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta422s-dedicated-exploitation-loop-same-week-after-week) 
 ,
 [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/grus-bluedelta-targets-key-networks-in-europe-with-multi-phase-espionage-camp) 
 and others reveal that while the infrastructure used by Fighting Ursa varies for different attack campaigns, the group frequently relies on these freely available services.Furthermore, the tactics from this campaign fit with previously documented Fighting Ursa campaigns, and the
 [HeadLace backdoor is exclusive to this threat actor](https://securityintelligence.com/x-force/itg05-ops-leverage-israel-hamas-conflict-lures-to-deliver-headlace-malware/) 
. 


Conclusion
----------



 Fighting Ursa is a motivated threat actor.The infrastructure the group uses has constantly changed and evolved, as noted in a
 [recent report](https://www.recordedfuture.com/grus-bluedelta-targets-key-networks-in-europe-with-multi-phase-espionage-camp) 
 from Recorded Future.Other industry reports have also shown various lures this actor uses in attempts to drop HeadLace malware. 



 We assess that Fighting Ursa will continue to use legitimate web services in its attack infrastructure.To defend against these attacks, defenders should limit access to these or similar hosting services as necessary.If possible, organizations should scrutinize the use of these free services to identify possible attack vectors. 


### Palo Alto Networks Protection and Mitigation



 Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from the threats discussed above through the following products:
