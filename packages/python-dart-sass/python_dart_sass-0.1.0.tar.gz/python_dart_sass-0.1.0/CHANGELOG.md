- **Importer registry** with file and custom importer support
- **Value conversion system** for bidirectional Python â†” Sass value conversion
- **CLI interface** for command-line usage
- **Comprehensive error handling** with source location information

### Technical Details

#### Architecture
- **Reactive streams** using RxPY for message handling
- **Immutable data structures** for Sass values using immutables library
- **Type safety** with comprehensive type hints throughout
