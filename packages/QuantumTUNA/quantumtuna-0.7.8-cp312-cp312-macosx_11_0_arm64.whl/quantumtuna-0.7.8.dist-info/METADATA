## Contents

The repository includes:

* This README file
* The TUNA logo
* The file LICENSE with the MIT license
* The folder TUNA containing Python files
* The installation file pyproject.toml
* The TUNA manual
* A changelog

## Documentation

A copy of the <a href="./TUNA%20Manual.pdf">TUNA Manual</a> can be found in this repository, and in the directory where the Python files are installed.

## Using TUNA

### Prerequisites
The program requires Python 3.12 or higher and the following packages:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* termcolor

### Installation

The simplest way to install TUNA is by running

```
pip install QuantumTUNA
```

Find the path to where TUNA is installed, `*/TUNA/`, with the other Python site packages.

On Windows, add this folder to PATH. One way to do this is with PowerShell, by

```
setx PATH "C:\*\TUNA;%PATH%"
```

On MacOS, find this folder's path and from a terminal, run

```
echo "alias tuna=/*/TUNA/tuna.py" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "alias TUNA=/*/TUNA/tuna.py" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then, in a new terminal, run ```TUNA --version``` which should print the correct version if TUNA has installed correctly.

### Running

The syntax of the command to run a TUNA calculation is

```
TUNA [Calculation] : [Atom A] [Atom B] [Distance] : [Method] [Basis]
```
