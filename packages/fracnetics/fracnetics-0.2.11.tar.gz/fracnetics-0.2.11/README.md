# Fractnetics

**Fractnetics** is a Python library for **Genetic Network Programming (GNP)** enhanced with **fractal geometry**, designed to model scalable, recursive, and self-similar network structures inspired by biological evolution and natural growth patterns.

> Bridging evolution, networks, and fractal recursion into one framework.

## ðŸ”¬ Overview

Fractnetics extends traditional **Genetic Network Programming** with **fractal expansion**, enabling dynamic and hierarchical structure generation. It is designed for researchers and developers exploring:

- Evolutionary network design
- Recursive architecture formation
- Bio-inspired optimization and simulation
- Complex systems with self-similar topology
