## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
<!-- Adjust the link of the second command to your own repo -->

The required packages to run this code can be found in the requirements.txt file. To run this file, execute the following code block after cloning the repository:

```bash
pip install .
```

or

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/StephanAkkerman/x-timeline-scraper.git
```

## Usage ‚å®Ô∏è

To use the X-Timeline Scraper, you need to provide a cURL command that accesses the desired X timeline. The instructions can be found in [curl_example.txt](curl_example.txt). Then, you can use the `XTimelineClient` class to fetch and parse tweets.

Here's a simple example of how to use the client:

```python
import asyncio
from src.xclient import XTimelineClient

async with XTimelineClient(
        "curl.txt", persist_last_id_path="state/last_id.txt"
    ) as xc:
        tweets = await xc.fetch_tweets(update_last_id=False)
        for t in tweets:
            print(t.to_markdown())
```

You can also stream new tweets in real-time:

```python
import asyncio
from src.xclient import XTimelineClient
async with XTimelineClient(
        "curl.txt", persist_last_id_path="state/last_id.txt"
    ) as xc:
        async for t in xc.stream(interval_s=5.0):
            print(t.to_markdown())
```
