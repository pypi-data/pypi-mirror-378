    Your allocation_changes MUST use ONLY the symbols that have been analyzed.

    MANDATORY REGULATORY LIMITS:
    - Maximum 15% allocation per asset
    - Maximum 40% allocation per sector
    - Allocations must be non-negative and sum to â‰¤100%

    Consider:
    - Risk-adjusted returns across opportunities
    - Portfolio diversification requirements
    - Implementation complexity and costs
    - Market timing and execution strategy

    Balance opportunity with prudent risk management.
    All AllocationChange entries MUST reference ONLY symbols from the risk assessment.
