# Adobe Customer Journey API

-----------------------

This is a python wrapper for the Adobe Customer Journey API.\
One important element when starting with CJA API is that you need to have your adobe console.io Project containing access to AEP **and** CJA.\
You cannot use the API without having access to both elements.
