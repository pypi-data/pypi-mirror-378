# pmsampsize

Sample size for development of a prediction model.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install pmsampsize
```

## Usage

`pmsampsize` computes the minimum sample size required for the development of a new multivariable prediction model using the criteria proposed by [Riley et al. (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.7992). `pmsampsize` can be used to calculate the minimum sample size for the development of models with continuous, binary or survival (time-to-event) outcomes. [Riley et al. (2018)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.7992) lay out a series of criteria the sample size should meet. These aim to minimise the overfitting and to ensure precise estimation of key parameters in the prediction model.

```python
from pmsampsize.pmsampsize import *

samplesize = pmsampsize(type="b", cstatistic=0.89, parameters=24, prevalence=0.174) # change options to meet your requirements
```
