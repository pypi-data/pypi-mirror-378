## 🔧 Configuration


### Extending Rules

validate-actions supports custom. You can extend the tool with your own rules without modifying the core codebase.

See [validate_actions/rules/rules.yml](validate_actions/rules/rules.yml) for configuration format and examples of creating custom rules.

## 🏃‍♂️ Integration Examples

### Pre-commit Hook
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: validate-actions
        name: Validate GitHub Actions
        entry: validate-actions
        language: system
        files: ^\.github/workflows/.*\.ya?ml$
```

*Note: Requires `validate-actions` to be installed globally or available in your PATH. For poetry projects, consider using `entry: poetry run validate-actions`.*

### VS Code Task
```json
// .vscode/tasks.json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Validate Actions",
      "type": "shell", 
      "command": "validate-actions",
      "group": "build",
      "presentation": {
        "echo": true,
        "reveal": "always"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

*Note: Assumes global installation (`pip install validate-actions`). For other setups, replace `command` with:*
- *Poetry: `"poetry run validate-actions"`*
- *Pipx: `"pipx run validate-actions"`*
- ...

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate.yml
name: Validate Workflows
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'
      - run: pip install validate-actions
      - name: Validate with warning limit
        run: validate-actions
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
*Note: Use `--max-warnings N` to set warning limits, or `--quiet` to suppress warning output entirely.*

---

## 🚦 Exit Codes

- **0**: Success (no errors, warnings under limit)
- **1**: Errors found OR warnings exceed `--max-warnings` limit

By default, warnings don't cause exit code 1 (non-blocking):
```bash
validate-actions              # Exit 0 even with warnings
validate-actions --quiet      # Exit 0, suppress warning output  
```

Use `--max-warnings` to fail builds when warnings exceed a threshold:
```bash
validate-actions --max-warnings 0    # Exit 1 on any warnings (strict)
validate-actions --max-warnings 5    # Exit 1 if more than 5 warnings
```

Perfect for CI/CD integration:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate.yml
- name: Validate Workflows (Allow Warnings)
  run: validate-actions
  # Will only fail on errors, not warnings
```
