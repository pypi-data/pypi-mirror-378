ADAM is the ATMOS Analogue Digital Twin, a Python package that provides tools and predictive models for analyzing lake breezes using NEXRAD radar data.
This initial package contains a model that determines the lake breeze front location from the 0.5 degree scan of the NEXRAD radar.

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install ADAM is via pip. This will ensure you get the latest stable release and 
all required dependencies:

.. code-block:: console

        pip install adam-atmos

Getting Started
---------------


After installation, you can import ADAM in your Python scripts or notebooks:

.. code-block:: python

        import adam

ADAM includes a predictive model for detecting and analyzing lake breezes from NEXRAD radar data.
See the documentation and example notebooks for usage details.
