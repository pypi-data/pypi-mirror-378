# AbstractAgent

**🚧 PLACEHOLDER PACKAGE 🚧**

This is a **placeholder package** to secure the "AbstractAgent" name on PyPI for future development.

## Overview

AbstractAgent will be a Python library for creating autonomous stateful agents with advanced memory capabilities. This package represents a planned modularization of agent functionality currently present in the AbstractLLM project, providing better separation of concerns and enhanced evolution capabilities.

## Current Status

**This package is currently a PLACEHOLDER with no functional implementation.**

## Planned Features

When fully implemented, AbstractAgent will provide:

- 🤖 **Autonomous Stateful Agents**: Self-managing agents that maintain state across interactions
- 🧠 **Advanced Memory Systems**: Sophisticated memory management for long-term context retention
- 🏗️ **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for better maintainability
- 🔄 **Enhanced Evolution**: Improved capabilities for agent learning and adaptation
- 🔌 **AbstractLLM Integration**: Seamless integration with AbstractLLM backends

## Development Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Current): Placeholder package to secure PyPI name ✅
- **Phase 2** (Planned): Design and architecture planning
- **Phase 3** (Planned): Core agent implementation
- **Phase 4** (Planned): Memory system implementation
- **Phase 5** (Planned): Integration and testing

## Installation

```bash
pip install AbstractAgent
```

## Usage (Placeholder)

```python
from abstractagent import AbstractAgent

# This is a placeholder - no functional implementation yet
agent = AbstractAgent()
print(agent.get_info())
```
