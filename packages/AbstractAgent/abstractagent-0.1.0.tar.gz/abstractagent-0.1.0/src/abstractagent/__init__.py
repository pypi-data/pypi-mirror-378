AbstractAgent - Placeholder Package

This is a placeholder package to secure the AbstractAgent name on PyPI.
The actual implementation will provide autonomous stateful agents with advanced memory,
building upon and modularizing the agent functionality currently in AbstractLLM.

Future functionality will include:
- Autonomous stateful agents
- Advanced memory systems
- Modular architecture for better separation of concerns
- Enhanced evolution capabilities over time

Current Status: PLACEHOLDER - No functional implementation yet.
