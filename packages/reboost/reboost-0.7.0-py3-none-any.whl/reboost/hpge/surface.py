    """Computes the distance from each step to the detector surface.

    The calculation can be performed for any surface type `nplus`, `pplus`,
    `passive` or `None`. In order to speed up the calculation we provide
    an option to only compute the distance for points within a certain distance
    of any surface (as computed by remage and stored in the "distances_precompute") argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions_x
        Global x positions for each step.
    positions_y
        Global y positions for each step.
    positions_z
        Global z positions for each step.
    hpge
        HPGe object.
    det_pos
        position of the detector origin, must be a 3 component array corresponding to `(x,y,z)`.
    surface_type
        string of which surface to use, can be `nplus`, `pplus` `passive` or None (in which case the distance to any surface is calculated).
    unit
        unit for the hit tier positions table.
    distances_precompute
        VectorOfVectors of distance to any surface computed by remage.
    precompute_cutoff
        cutoff on distances_precompute to not compute the distance for (in mm)

    Returns
    -------
    VectorOfVectors with the same shape as `positions_x/y/z` of the distance to the surface.

    Note
    ----
    `positions_x/positions_y/positions_z` must all have the same shape.
