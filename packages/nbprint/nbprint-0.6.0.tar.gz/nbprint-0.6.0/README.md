## Installation

Install with `pip`:

```bash
pip install nbprint
```

Install with `conda`

```bash
conda install nbprint -c conda-forge
```

## Background

Jupyter Notebooks are widely used for reports via [`nbconvert`](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Most efforts focus on building web reports / websites from notebooks, including [`Voilà`](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) and [`Jupyter Book`](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).

Despite being the primary goal of early notebook conversion efforts, in recent years much less focus has been spent on print media - PDFs for reports, academic papers, newspapers, etc. There are many examples of `nbconvert` templates for academic papers, as well as projects like [`ipypublish`](https://github.com/chrisjsewell/ipypublish/tree/develop). Most of these efforts focus on $\\LaTeX$, and indeed `nbprint` itself started as convenience framework for formatting charts and tables similarly between html and pdf outputs.

However, with recent releases to `nbconvert`, which now supports `webpdf` (printing as pdf from within a headless web browser), and with advances to the `@media print` CSS directive spearheaded by the lovely folks at [`pagedjs`](https://pagedjs.org), it is now much easier to build publication ready print-oriented media on the web.

This is the goal of `nbprint`. Using [`pagedjs`](https://pagedjs.org), `nbprint` provides templates and utilities for building web reports targeting print media. Beyond that, it provides infrastructure for parameterizing and configuring documents via [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), which makes designing and generating reports a breeze, even without knowledge of Python. Documents are modular and can be easily composed via [`hydra`](https://hydra.cc).

## Quickstart

`nbprint` can be used purely via notebook metadata, but it also provides a `yaml`-based framework for configuration (via [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), [`hydra`](https://hydra.cc), and [`omegaconf`](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf)). This is particularly convenient when generating parameterized reports, for example when configuring a large number of hyperparameters for a model's evaluation report. This configuration also allows for easier iteration on a report's design and content.

### Configuration

Let's take a simple placeholder report.

```yaml
---
debug: false
outputs:
  _target_: nbprint:NBConvertOutputs
  path_root: ./examples/output
  target: "html"

content:
  - _target_: nbprint:ContentMarkdown
    content: |
      # A Generic Report
      ## A Subtitle
    css: ":scope { text-align: center; }"

  - _target_: nbprint:ContentPageBreak

  - _target_: nbprint:ContentTableOfContents

  - _target_: nbprint:ContentPageBreak

  - _target_: nbprint:ContentMarkdown
    content: |
      # Section One
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
      ## Subsection One
      Consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt.
      ## Subsection Two
      Ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

  - _target_: nbprint:ContentPageBreak

  - _target_: nbprint:ContentFlexRowLayout
    sizes: [1, 1]
    content:
      - _target_: nbprint:ContentFlexColumnLayout
        content:
          - _target_: nbprint:ContentMarkdown
            content: |
              # Section Two
              Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
              ## Subsection One
              Consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt.

      - _target_: nbprint:ContentFlexColumnLayout
        content:
          - _target_: nbprint:ContentMarkdown
            content: |
              # Section Three
              Ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
              ## Subsection One
              Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud.
```

Let's break this down step by step.

First, we configure `debug: false`. This tells `nbprint` to run `pagedjs` print preview. We also set the output to run `nbconvert` and configure the folder for outputs to be placed.

Next we fill in some content. Here we use a few components:

- `ContentMarkdown` to generate Markdown cells
- `ContentPageBreak` to split onto a new page in our pdf
- `ContentTableOfContents` to create a table of contents. Note that this will work in both html preview, and pdf form!
- `ContentFlexRowLayout` and `ContentFlexColumnLayout` to create some layout structure for our document.

### Run

We can now generate the report by running the CLI:

```bash
nbprint run examples/basic.yaml basic
```

This will create a Notebook output in our specified folder `examples/output`, as well as an html asset (since that is what we specified in the yaml file). Both will have the date as a suffix, which is also configurable in our yaml. We see the generated report notebook, which we can open and use for further experimentation or to investigate the report itself.

We also see the html document itself, which will be rendered via [`pagedjs`](https://pagedjs.org) print preview.
