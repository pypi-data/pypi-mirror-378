## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, **please do not create a public issue**. Instead, report it privately by emailing:

**kalfasyan+security@gmail.com**

Please include as much detail as possible to help me quickly understand and address the issue. I will respond as soon as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure process as appropriate.

- I appreciate responsible disclosure.
- After a fix is released, I will credit reporters (if desired) in the release notes.
