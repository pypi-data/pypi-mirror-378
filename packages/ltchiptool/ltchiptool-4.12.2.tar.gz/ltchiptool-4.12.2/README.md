## What is this?

This repository is a collection of tools, used in the [LibreTiny project](https://github.com/kuba2k2/libretiny), that perform some chip-specific tasks, like packaging binary images or uploading firmware to the chip.

Since v2.0.0, it contains a common, chip-independent CLI and API for interacting with supported chips in download mode (reading/writing flash).

Since v3.0.0, it contains a beginner-friendly GUI for flashing firmware or dumping flash contents.
