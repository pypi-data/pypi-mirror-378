    "## MDPax Problem class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Problem` class is used to represent MDPs in MDPax. As described in the [Getting Started] notebook, it uses a functional approach to describe the MDP instead of explicitly creating transition and reward matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a subclass of `Problem` to represent your own MDP, you will need to define an `__init__` method and the following methods marked as `@abstractmethods` in the `Problem` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `name`: A unique string identifier for the MDP\n",
    "* `_construct_state_space`: A helper function that builds an array of all possible states, with dimensions [n_states, state_dim]\n",
    "* `state_to_index`: A function that maps from a state vector to its index in the state space array\n",
    "* `_construct_action_space`: A helper function that builds an array of all possible actions, with dimensions [n_actions, action_dim]\n",
    "* `_construct_random_event_space`: A helper function that builds an array of all possible random events, with dimensions [n_events, event_dim]\n",
    "* `random_event_probability`: A function that returns the probability of a random event given a state and action\n",
    "* `transition`: A function that returns the next state and reward given a state, action, and random event. \n",
    "\n",
    "See the [MDPax documentation](https://mdpax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for detailed information about the `Problem` class.\n",
    "\n",
