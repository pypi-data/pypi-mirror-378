## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The tool uses a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) for all settings:

```yaml
# General Settings
queue_size: 1000
update_interval: 30
log_level: INFO

# AWS S3 Configuration
aws:
  enabled: true
  access_key: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
  secret_key: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
  region: us-east-1
  max_threads: 20

azure:
  enabled: true
  account_name: 'your-storage-account'
  account_key: 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_KEY'
  max_threads: 15
```

### Environment Variables

You can also use environment variables instead of storing credentials in the config:

```bash
# AWS
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"

# Google Cloud
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/service-account.json"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"

```

### Key Components

- **Certificate Stream Monitor**: Async WebSocket client for real-time CT log monitoring
- **Queue Manager**: Thread-safe, provider-specific queues with rate limiting
- **Provider Workers**: Modular cloud storage implementations with authentication
- **Permutation Generator**: Smart bucket name generation from domains
- **Result Handler**: Unified output formatting and logging

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Responsible Disclosure
This tool is designed for security research and authorized testing only. Always ensure you have permission before testing against any infrastructure.

### Rate Limiting
- Built-in rate limiting for all cloud providers
- Exponential backoff for rate limit responses
- Configurable request delays and timeouts

### Authentication
- Supports both authenticated and unauthenticated modes
- Higher thread limits and better access control detection when authenticated
- Secure credential handling via environment variables
