Generic buffers
===============

Most of the conversion functions target a particular library: NumPy, Arrow, Pandas, or Python itself. As a catch-all for other storage formats, Awkward Arrays can be converted to and from sets of named buffers. The buffers are not (usually) intelligible on their own; the length of the array and a JSON document are needed to reconstitute the original structure. This section will demonstrate how an array-set can be used to store an Awkward Array in an HDF5 file, which ordinarily wouldn't be able to represent nested, irregular data structures.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import awkward as ak
import numpy as np
import h5py
import json
```

From Awkward to buffers
-----------------------

Consider the following complex array:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ak_array = ak.Array(
    [
        [{"x": 1.1, "y": [1]}, {"x": 2.2, "y": [1, 2]}, {"x": 3.3, "y": [1, 2, 3]}],
        [],
        [{"x": 4.4, "y": [1, 2, 3, 4]}, {"x": 5.5, "y": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}],
    ]
)
ak_array
```

The {func}`ak.to_buffers` function decomposes it into a set of one-dimensional arrays (a zero-copy operation).

```{code-cell} ipython3
form, length, container = ak.to_buffers(ak_array)
```

The pieces needed to reconstitute this array are:

   * the {class}`ak.forms.Form`, which defines how structure is built from one-dimensional arrays,
   * the length of the original array,
   * the one-dimensional arrays in the `container` (a {class}`collections.abc.MutableMapping`).

The {class}`ak.forms.Form` is like an Awkward {class}`ak.types.Type` in that it describes how the data are structured, but with more detail: it includes distinctions such as the difference between {class}`ak.contents.ListArray` and {class}`ak.contents.ListOffsetArray`, as well as the integer types of structural {class}`ak.index.Index`.

It is usually presented as JSON, and has a compact JSON format (when {meth}`ak.forms.Form.tojson` is invoked).

```{code-cell} ipython3
form
```

In this case, the `length` is just an integer. It would be a list of integers if `ak_array` was partitioned.

```{code-cell} ipython3
length
```

This `container` is a new dict, but it could have been a user-specified {class}`collections.abc.MutableMapping` if passed into {func}`ak.to_buffers` as an argument.

```{code-cell} ipython3
container
```

From buffers to Awkward
-----------------------

The function that reverses {func}`ak.to_buffers` is {func}`ak.from_buffers`. Its first three arguments are `form`, `length`, and `container`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
ak.from_buffers(form, length, container)
```

Minimizing the size of the output buffers
-----------------------------------------

The {func}`ak.to_buffers`/{func}`ak.from_buffers` functions exactly preserve an array, warts and all. Often, you'll want to only write {func}`ak.to_packed` arrays. "Packing" replaces an array structure with an equivalent structure that has no unreachable elementsâ€”data that you can't see as part of the array, and therefore probably don't want to write.

Here is an example of an array in need of packing:

```{code-cell} ipython3
unpacked = ak.Array(
    ak.contents.ListArray(
        ak.index.Index64(np.array([4, 10, 1])),
        ak.index.Index64(np.array([7, 10, 3])),
        ak.contents.NumpyArray(np.array([999, 4.4, 5.5, 999, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 999])),
    )
)
unpacked
```

This {class}`ak.contents.ListArray` is in a strange order and the `999` values are unreachable. (Also, using `starts[1] == stops[1] == 10` to represent an empty list is a little odd, though allowed by the specification.)

The {func}`ak.to_buffers` function dutifully writes the `999` values into the output, even though they're not visible in the array.

```{code-cell} ipython3
ak.to_buffers(unpacked)
```

If the intended purpose of calling {func}`ak.to_buffers` is to write to a file or send data over a network, this is wasted space. It can be trimmed by calling the {func}`ak.to_packed` function.

```{code-cell} ipython3
packed = ak.to_packed(unpacked)
packed
```

At high-level, the array appears to be the same, but its low-level structure is quite different:

```{code-cell} ipython3
unpacked.layout
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
packed.layout
```

This version of the array is more concise when written with {func}`ak.to_buffers`:

```{code-cell} ipython3
ak.to_buffers(packed)
```

Saving Awkward Arrays to HDF5
-----------------------------

The [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/) library presents each group in an HDF5 file as a {class}`collections.abc.MutableMapping`, which we can use as a container for an array-set. We must also save the `form` and `length` as metadata for the array to be retrievable.

```{code-cell} ipython3
file = h5py.File("/tmp/example.hdf5", "w")
group = file.create_group("awkward")
group
```

We can fill this `group` as a `container` by passing it in to {func}`ak.to_buffers`. (See the previous section for more on {func}`ak.to_packed`.)

```{code-cell} ipython3
form, length, container = ak.to_buffers(ak.to_packed(ak_array), container=group)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
container
```

Now the HDF5 group has been filled with array pieces.

```{code-cell} ipython3
container.keys()
```

Here's one.

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.asarray(container["node0-offsets"])
```

Now we need to add the other information to the group as metadata. Since HDF5 accepts string-valued metadata, we can put it all in as JSON or numbers.

```{code-cell} ipython3
group.attrs["form"] = form.to_json()
group.attrs["form"]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
group.attrs["length"] = length
group.attrs["length"]
```

Reading Awkward Arrays from HDF5
--------------------------------

With that, we can reconstitute the array by supplying {func}`ak.from_buffers` the right arguments from the group and metadata.

The group can't be used as a `container` as-is, since subscripting it returns {class}`h5py.Dataset` objects, rather than arrays.

```{code-cell} ipython3
reconstituted = ak.from_buffers(
    ak.forms.from_json(group.attrs["form"]),
    group.attrs["length"],
    {k: np.asarray(v) for k, v in group.items()},
)
reconstituted
```
