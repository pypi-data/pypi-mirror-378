This module is intended to allow external AI systems to perform actions
with the correct context, based on triggers related to CRM Leads.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

- | **Bridge with ``Usage = "AI Thread Create"``**
  | Processes new CRM leads in the external system for AI-enhanced
    actions like lead enrichment or tailored follow up emails.

- | **Bridge with ``Usage = "AI Thread Write"``**
  | Updates lead information in the external system when leads are
    modified in Odoo.

- | **Bridge with ``Usage = "AI Thread Unlink"``**
  | Removes lead data from the external system when leads are deleted
    from Odoo.

For creating those bridges, apart from the usage of the bridge, the user
must define:

- Payload Type: it depends on the endpoint configuration, normally
  "Record" would work.
- Result Type: depending on your use case.
- Model: select the "CRM Lead" model
- Field: add at least the fields the endpoint is expecting (e.g., name,
  email, phone, company, etc.).
- Filter: add a domain for using the bridge only with the leads intended
  to trigger automatic actions

Usage
=====

Depending on the bridges you have created, create, update or delete a
CRM Lead mathing the bridge domain. You should see the execution on the
AI Bridge Execution menu.
