    Returns the core configuration instance.

    This function is intentionally implemented in a *delegation-aware* fashion
    so that if the attribute `core.config.get_core_config` is replaced at runtime
    (for example via `unittest.mock.patch` in the test-suite), **previously
    imported aliases** of this function will still transparently delegate to the
    patched version.

    Why is this necessary?
    ----------------------
    In a typical patching scenario tests execute:

    ```python
    with patch("core.config.get_core_config", return_value=mock_core_config):
        ...
    ```

    However, if another module (or the test itself) has already executed
    `from core.config import get_core_config`, they hold a *direct reference* to
    the original function object. Replacing the attribute on the module does
    **not** update that early-bound reference, so calls routed through the alias
    would bypass the patched function. To preserve expected behaviour we check
    whether the module attribute now points to **another callable** (the one
    injected by `patch`). If so, we delegate execution to it, ensuring call-
    counting and return-value expectations remain intact.
    """
    # Detect late-bound replacement of the module attribute performed by
    # `unittest.mock.patch`. If the current global attribute is **not** this
    # function object, it means a patch is active â€“ delegate the call.
    current_callable = globals().get("get_core_config")
    # Use the *original* function object captured at import time to detect
    # whether the module attribute has been monkey-patched. Relying on the

    # overwritten by `unittest.mock.patch`, making the identity comparison
