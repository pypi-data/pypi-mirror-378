---

### **Comprehensive Guide to Using the `ScriptRunner` Class**

The `ScriptRunner` class provides a streamlined interface for executing scripts across various interpreters, such as Node.js, Python, or others. It supports input handling, terminal execution, and capturing output, making it ideal for dynamic script management.

---

### **Initialization**
The `ScriptRunner` is initialized with a default interpreter, which will be used unless another is specified during execution.

```python
import YoungLion

# Initialize with a default interpreter (Node.js)
runner = Younglion.ScriptRunner(default_interpreter="node")

# Change the default interpreter
runner.set_default_interpreter("python")
```

---

### **Key Features and Methods**

#### **1. Setting and Validating Paths**
The `_validate_path` method ensures the provided script path is valid and converts it to an absolute path. If the file does not exist, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`.

```python
# Example usage (internal)
validated_path = runner._validate_path("script.js")
print(validated_path)  # Outputs the absolute path of the script
```

---

#### **2. Running Scripts**
The `run_script` method is the core functionality of this class. It allows executing scripts with a specified interpreter, in the terminal or background, with optional input and output handling.

**Parameters**:
- `path`: Path to the script file.
- `interpreter`: Interpreter to use (defaults to the class's default interpreter).
- `terminal`: If `True`, runs the script in a terminal window.
- `inputs`: Input data passed as a string or list of strings.
- `output`: If `True`, captures and returns the script output.

**Example: Basic Script Execution**
```python
# Run a Node.js script in the background
output = runner.run_script("script.js")
print(output)  # Prints the script output
```

**Example: Changing Interpreters**
```python
# Run a Python script with inputs
output = runner.run_script("script.py", interpreter="python", inputs=["arg1", "arg2"])
print(output)
```

**Example: Terminal Execution**
```python
# Run a script in the terminal (e.g., on macOS/Linux)
runner.run_script("script.js", terminal=True)
```

---

#### **3. Handling Inputs**
The `inputs` parameter can handle either a single string or a list of strings. The class ensures the inputs are formatted correctly for the script.

**Example: Passing Inputs**
```python
# Pass a single input string
runner.run_script("script.js", inputs="input_data")

# Pass multiple inputs as a list
runner.run_script("script.js", inputs=["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"])
```

---

#### **4. Output Management**
By default, the method captures and returns the script's output when executed in the background. If `output` is set to `False`, the script is executed without returning the output.

**Example: Suppressing Output**
```python
# Execute without returning output
runner.run_script("script.js", output=False)
```

---

#### **5. Terminal Execution**
When `terminal=True`, the script is run in a terminal window. This feature depends on the operating system and requires a terminal emulator.

- **Windows**: Uses the `cmd` terminal.
- **macOS/Linux**: Uses `xterm` or similar terminal emulators.

**Example: Terminal Execution**
```python
# Run a script in a terminal
runner.run_script("script.js", terminal=True)
```

If no terminal emulator is found, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

---

### **Error Handling**
The `ScriptRunner` class includes robust error handling for common issues:
1. **File Not Found**: If the script file path is invalid or does not exist.
2. **Interpreter Not Found**: If the specified interpreter is unavailable.
3. **Execution Errors**: If the script fails during execution (e.g., syntax errors).

**Example: Error Handling**
```python
try:
    runner.run_script("nonexistent.js")
except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Execution Error: {e}")
```

---

### **Changing the Default Interpreter**
You can dynamically update the default interpreter using the `set_default_interpreter` method.

```python
# Change to Python as the default interpreter
runner.set_default_interpreter("python")

# Execute a Python script using the new default interpreter
runner.run_script("example.py")
```

---

### **Advantages**
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple interpreters (e.g., Node.js, Python).
- **Input Handling**: Seamless integration of inputs for scripts.
- **Terminal/Background Execution**: Run scripts in various modes depending on your needs.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with appropriate configurations.

---

### **Usage Scenarios**
- **Automated Script Execution**: Dynamically run scripts for tasks such as testing or data processing.
- **Multi-Interpreter Environments**: Manage scripts in different programming languages without switching environments.
- **Real-Time Input/Output**: Capture output and integrate with larger Python workflows.

The `ScriptRunner` class is a powerful utility for developers needing streamlined script execution across diverse environments. It bridges the gap between Python and other runtime environments, making it an essential tool for automation and scripting.

---

### **Comprehensive Guide to Using the `TaskScheduler` Class**

The `TaskScheduler` class is a robust solution for managing and executing tasks with features such as priority-based scheduling, pausing/resuming tasks, repeating intervals, and detailed task tracking. Designed with multi-threading and thread safety, it is ideal for building dynamic and flexible applications.

---

### **Initialization**
The `TaskScheduler` initializes the necessary data structures and locks for managing tasks. 

```python
import YoungLion

# Initialize a TaskScheduler instance
scheduler = YoungLion.TaskScheduler()
```

---

### **Key Features and Methods**

#### **1. Scheduling Tasks**
The `schedule_task` method allows scheduling tasks with optional repeating intervals and priority control.

**Parameters**:
- `task`: The callable function to execute.
- `interval`: Time interval (in seconds) for repeating tasks. If `None`, the task runs only once.
- `repeat`: Whether the task repeats (`True`) or runs once (`False`).
- `priority`: Lower values indicate higher priority.

**Returns**: A unique `task_id` for tracking the task.

**Example: One-Time Task**
```python
# Schedule a one-time task
task_id = scheduler.schedule_task(lambda: print("Hello, world!"), repeat=False)
```

**Example: Repeating Task**
```python
# Schedule a repeating task with an interval of 5 seconds
task_id = scheduler.schedule_task(lambda: print("Repeating task"), interval=5, repeat=True)
```

**Example: Priority-Based Task Scheduling**
```python
# Schedule tasks with different priorities
scheduler.schedule_task(lambda: print("High priority task"), priority=1)
scheduler.schedule_task(lambda: print("Low priority task"), priority=10)
```

---

#### **2. Pausing and Resuming Tasks**
Tasks can be paused and resumed using their unique `task_id`.

**Pausing a Task**
```python
# Pause a running task
scheduler.pause_task(task_id)
```

**Resuming a Task**
```python
# Resume a paused task
scheduler.resume_task(task_id)
```

**Example: Pausing and Resuming**
```python
# Pause and resume a repeating task
scheduler.pause_task(task_id)
scheduler.resume_task(task_id)
```

---

#### **3. Canceling Tasks**
Tasks can be canceled at any point using their `task_id`. This sets the task's status to `"cancelled"` and prevents further execution.

**Example: Cancel a Task**
```python
scheduler.cancel_task(task_id)
```

---

#### **4. Listing Tasks**
The `list_tasks` method displays all scheduled tasks with their:
- **Status**: `running`, `paused`, `queued`, or `cancelled`.
- **Priority**: Task priority level.
- **Repeat**: Whether the task repeats.

**Example: List All Tasks**
```python
scheduler.list_tasks()
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Scheduled Tasks:
ID: 12345, Status: running, Priority: 5, Repeat: True
ID: 67890, Status: paused, Priority: 10, Repeat: False
```

---

#### **5. Thread Safety**
The `TaskScheduler` uses threading locks to ensure thread-safe operations, especially when modifying shared data like `tasks` and `task_status`.

**Internal Example: Lock Usage**
```python
with self.lock:
    # Safe access or modification of shared resources
    self.task_status[task_id] = "paused"
```

---

### **Advanced Concepts**

#### **Task Lifecycle**
1. **Queued**: The task is added to the priority queue but has not started execution.
2. **Running**: The task is actively executing.
3. **Paused**: The task is temporarily halted and can be resumed.
4. **Cancelled**: The task is stopped and will not execute further.
5. **Completed**: The task has finished execution.

#### **Priority Queue**
Tasks are added to a priority queue (`PriorityQueue`), ensuring higher-priority tasks are executed first.

---

### **Error Handling**
The `TaskScheduler` provides robust error handling:
- Ensures invalid operations (e.g., pausing a completed task) are gracefully managed.
- Catches and logs exceptions during task execution without crashing the scheduler.

**Example: Error Handling**
```python
# Schedule a task with intentional error
def faulty_task():
    raise ValueError("An intentional error.")

scheduler.schedule_task(faulty_task)

# Output: Task <task_id> encountered an error: An intentional error.
```

---

### **Advantages**
- **Flexibility**: Supports both one-time and repeating tasks.
- **Priority-Based Execution**: Ensures critical tasks are executed first.
- **Thread Safety**: Enables safe multi-threaded task management.
- **Dynamic Control**: Tasks can be paused, resumed, and canceled dynamically.
