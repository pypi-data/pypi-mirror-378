# AbstractSwarm

> **ðŸš§ PLACEHOLDER PROJECT ðŸš§**
> 
> This is currently a **placeholder project** to secure the `AbstractSwarm` name on PyPI.

## Overview

AbstractSwarm is designed to be a Python library for handling and orchestrating multiple agents to perform higher-level tasks in coordination. The global entity is called a "swarm" to reflect the common goals and collaborative nature of the agents.

## Planned Features

- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple agents working towards common objectives
- **Task Distribution**: Intelligent distribution of tasks across agent swarms
- **Communication Protocols**: Efficient inter-agent communication mechanisms
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Algorithms for emergent collective behavior
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Frameworks for collaborative problem-solving

## Current Status

This package is currently a **placeholder** to reserve the PyPI name. No functional code is implemented yet.

## Installation

```bash
pip install AbstractSwarm
```

## Usage

```python
import abstractswarm
# This will display a placeholder notice
```

## Future Development

The project aims to provide:

1. **Swarm Management**: Tools for creating, managing, and coordinating agent swarms
2. **Task Orchestration**: High-level task decomposition and assignment
3. **Agent Communication**: Protocols for agent-to-agent and agent-to-swarm communication
4. **Intelligence Emergence**: Algorithms that enable emergent swarm behaviors
5. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization across the swarm
