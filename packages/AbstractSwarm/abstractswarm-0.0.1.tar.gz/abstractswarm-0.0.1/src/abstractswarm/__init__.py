AbstractSwarm - A placeholder project for orchestrating multiple agents.

This is a PLACEHOLDER PROJECT to secure the AbstractSwarm name on PyPI.

The project aims at handling and orchestrating multiple agents to perform 
higher-level tasks in coordination. The global entity is called "swarm" to 
reflect the common goals of those agents.

Future versions will include:
- Agent coordination mechanisms
- Task distribution and orchestration
- Communication protocols between agents
- Swarm intelligence algorithms
- Multi-agent collaboration frameworks
