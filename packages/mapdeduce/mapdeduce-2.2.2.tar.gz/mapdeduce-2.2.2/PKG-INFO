# mapdeduce

A python library for:

-   Handling antigenic maps and sequence data.
-   Testing associations between amino acid polymorphisms and antigenic
    diversity.
-   Plotting antigenic maps.

![Example](data/example.png)

## Installation

```bash
# An R dependency
Rscript -e 'install.packages("statmod")'

# The python package
pip install git+https://github.com/acorg/mapdeduce.git
```

R is also required, with the "statmod" library.
