# AlphaBuilder-Signal

**AlphaBuilder-Signal** is an experimental Python package that will provide a curated library of trading signals for quantitative finance.  

This package is currently in **early development** (blank scaffolding), but the vision is to offer:  

- ✅ **Technical indicators** (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, etc.)  
- ✅ **Fundamental indicators** (valuation metrics, earnings data, etc.)  
- ✅ **Handcrafted signals** (curated alpha factors and custom rules)  
- ✅ **ML-based signals** (tree models, RNNs, transformers applied to time series)  
- ✅ **Regime-aware signals** (HMMs, regime switching filters)  
- ✅ **Backtesting utilities** (Sharpe ratio, hit ratio, performance metrics)
