        Analyzes a provider/resource to determine the appropriate cleanup
        strategy. This is a pure function with no side effects that checks
        for cleanup protocols.

        When a resource has both sync and async cleanup methods, the async
        methods take priority. This is by design - if a resource provides
        async cleanup, it's likely designed for async usage. Resources that
        need to work in both contexts should be registered separately or
        use a wrapper that provides the appropriate interface.

        Priority order:
            1. Async context manager (__aenter__/__aexit__)
            2. Sync context manager (__enter__/__exit__)
            3. Async cleanup (aclose)
            4. Sync cleanup (close)
            5. No cleanup needed

            provider: The provider/resource to analyze for cleanup capabilities

        Returns:
