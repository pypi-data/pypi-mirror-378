A CLI tool for managing Python virtual environments using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). Think `pyenv-virtualenv` but powered by the speed of `uv`.

## Features

- 🚀 **Fast**: Leverages uv's speed for Python installation and environment creation
- 🎯 **Simple**: Intuitive CLI commands for common virtual environment operations
- 🔒 **Reproducible**: Lockfile support for consistent environments across systems
- 🐚 **Shell Integration**: Easy activation/deactivation in bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell
- 📊 **Rich Metadata**: Track environment descriptions, tags, usage patterns, and project links
- 🧹 **Smart Cleanup**: Automatic detection and removal of unused environments
- 📈 **Usage Analytics**: Detailed insights into environment usage and health status
- 🔐 **Azure DevOps Integration**: Seamless setup for private package feeds with automatic authentication

## Installation

```bash
pip install uvve
```

**Prerequisites**: Ensure [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is installed:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install shell integration (one-time setup)
uvve shell-integration --print >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc

# Install a Python version
uvve python install 3.11

# Create a virtual environment
uvve create myproject 3.11

# Activate the environment
uvve activate myproject

# List environments
uvve list

# Remove an environment
uvve remove myproject
```

## Basic Usage

### Creating Environments

```bash
# Basic environment creation
uvve create myproject 3.11

# Create with rich metadata
uvve create myapi 3.11 --description "Customer API" --add-tag production --add-tag api

# Interactive metadata entry (prompts for description and tags)
uvve create webapp 3.11
```

### Environment Management

```bash
# List all environments
uvve list

# List with usage statistics
uvve list --usage

# Activate an environment (with shell integration)
uvve activate myproject

# Or activate with eval (without shell integration)
eval "$(uvve activate myproject)"

# Set up automatic activation for a directory
uvve local myproject  # Creates .uvve-version file
cd /path/to/project   # Auto-activates when shell integration is installed

# Add packages to active environment
uvve activate myproject
uvve add requests django==4.2  # Uses uv for fast installation

# Create and restore from lockfiles
uvve lock myproject   # Captures all installed packages
uvve thaw myproject   # Restores packages from lockfile

# View installed packages
uvve freeze myproject              # Show all packages
uvve freeze myproject --tracked-only  # Show only manually added packages

# View environment analytics
uvve analytics myproject

# Check utility status of all environments
uvve status

# Find and clean unused environments
uvve cleanup --dry-run
uvve cleanup --unused-for 60 --interactive

# Edit environment metadata
uvve edit myproject --description "My web API" --add-tag "production"

# Clean up unused environments
uvve cleanup --dry-run
```

### Python Version Management

```bash
# Install Python versions
uvve python install 3.11
uvve python install 3.12

# List available and installed versions
uvve python list
```

## Advanced Usage

### Environment Activation Methods

There are two ways to work with uvve activation:

**Method 1: Shell Integration (Recommended)**

```bash
# One-time setup:
uvve shell-integration >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc

# Then simply:
uvve activate myproject
```

**Method 2: Direct Evaluation**

```bash
eval "$(uvve activate myproject)"
```

**Why prefer shell integration?**

- ✅ Simpler command (no `eval` needed)
- ✅ More intuitive for users
- ✅ Consistent with other environment managers
- ✅ One-time setup, lifetime benefit
- ✅ Automatic activation via `.uvve-version` files

**When to use `eval` method:**

- ⚙️ Automation scripts and CI/CD
- ⚙️ One-off usage without permanent setup
- ⚙️ Shell functions where integration isn't available

### Directory-Based Activation

With shell integration installed, you can set up automatic environment activation:

```bash
# Set up a project to auto-activate an environment
cd /path/to/my/project
uvve local myproject  # Creates .uvve-version file

# Now whenever you cd into this directory (or subdirectories)
# the environment will automatically activate
cd /path/to/my/project  # Auto-activates 'myproject'
cd /path/to/my/project/src  # Still uses 'myproject'
cd /path/to/other/project  # Deactivates when leaving

# View which environment is set for current directory
cat .uvve-version  # Shows: myproject
```

**How it works:**

- Shell integration hooks into directory changes
- Looks for `.uvve-version` files in current directory
- Automatically activates the specified environment
- Works across bash, zsh, and fish shells

### Package Management

uvve provides a streamlined workflow for managing packages in your environments:

```bash
# Activate an environment first
uvve activate myproject

# Add packages (uses uv for fast installation)
uvve add requests            # Latest version
uvve add django==4.2        # Specific version
uvve add "fastapi>=0.68.0"   # Version constraint

# View installed packages
uvve freeze myproject        # All packages
uvve freeze myproject --tracked-only  # Only manually added packages

# Create reproducible environments
uvve lock myproject          # Capture exact versions
uvve thaw myproject          # Restore from lockfile
```

**How it works:**

- `uvve add` requires an active environment (safety feature)
- Uses `uv pip install` for fast package installation
- Tracks manually added packages in `uvve.requirements.txt`
- Lockfiles capture complete environment state
- `thaw` restores tracked packages automatically

### Azure DevOps Integration

Set up private package feeds with automatic authentication:

```bash
# Activate an environment first (preferred method with shell integration)
uvve activate myproject

# Or with eval method
# eval "$(uvve activate myproject)"

# Set up Azure DevOps feed
uvve setup-azure --feed-url "https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/myorg/_packaging/myfeed/pypi/simple/" --feed-name "private-feed"

# Add environment variables to your shell
export UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER=subprocess
export UV_INDEX_PRIVATE_FEED_USERNAME=VssSessionToken

# Authenticate with Azure CLI
az login

# Check configuration status
uvve feed-status
```

### Analytics and Cleanup

```bash
# View detailed environment analytics
uvve analytics myproject

# Check health status of all environments
uvve status

# Clean up unused environments
uvve cleanup --unused-for 60 --interactive
uvve cleanup --dry-run  # Preview what would be removed
```

### Shell Completion

```bash
# Auto-install completion for your shell
uvve --install-completion

# Or manually add to your shell config
uvve --show-completion >> ~/.zshrc
```
