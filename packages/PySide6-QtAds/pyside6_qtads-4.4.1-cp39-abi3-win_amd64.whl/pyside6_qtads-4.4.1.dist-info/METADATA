# PySide6-QtAds
[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/Pyside6-QtAds.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pyside6-QtAds/)
![Monthly Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/PySide6-QtAds)

Python/PySide6 bindings to the [Qt Advanced Docking System](https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System) library.

Pre-built wheels are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can install with:

```
pip install PySide6-QtAds
```

You may also build from source. Example build from source on Ubuntu 24.04:

```bash
# Install Qt (for example, using aqtinstall)
pip install aqtinstall
aqt install-qt linux desktop 6.9.2 --outputdir qt

# Build PySide6-QtAds
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/qt/6.9.2/gcc_64/lib \
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PWD/qt/6.9.2/gcc_64/lib/cmake/ \
PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://download.qt.io/official_releases/QtForPython/ \
pip install -v .
```

Note: `shiboken6-generator` is required when building from source. It will be downloaded automatically in the command above from Qt's package index, as it is not available on PyPI.
