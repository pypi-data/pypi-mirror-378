"""
Aparecium Custom Exceptions

This module defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for Aparecium. All exceptions
inherit from the base ApareciumError, making it easier to catch any Aparecium-related
errors in a single block if desired.

Typical usage example:
    from exceptions import DatabaseError

    try:
        # Some DB operation
    except DatabaseError as exc:
        handle_db_issue(exc)
"""


class ApareciumError(Exception):
    """
    Base exception for all Aparecium-related errors.

    Inherits from the built-in Exception class. You can catch this to handle any error
    specific to Aparecium in a generic way.
    """

    pass


class DatabaseError(ApareciumError):
    """

class VectorizationError(ApareciumError):
    """
    Raised when there are issues with text vectorization.

    For example, if tokenization or model inference fails, this exception may be used.

    pass


class ReverserError(ApareciumError):
