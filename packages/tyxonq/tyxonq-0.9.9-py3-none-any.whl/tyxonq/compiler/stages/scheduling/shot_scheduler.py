"""Shot scheduler: bridge measurement grouping to executable shot segments.

Why this exists
---------------
- Provide a single place to turn measurement grouping metadata into a concrete
  execution plan (segments), decoupling scheduling from device executors.
- Unify two common modes: explicit shot vectors from users and automatic
  distribution based on grouping weights.

What it does
------------
- Reads `Circuit.metadata["measurement_groups"]` (produced by the measurement
  rewrite stage) and assigns per-group shot budgets.
- Emits a plan with segments that carry `shots`, `basis`, `wires`, and
  `basis_map` to inform downstream executors of measurement settings reuse.

Why this is better than adâ€‘hoc scheduling
----------------------------------------
- Explicit and testable: plan is data, easy to inspect and unit test.
- Decoupled: devices/session only consume the plan, no embedded policy logic.
- Extensible: cost models (weights, rounding policy) can evolve without
  touching executors or groupers.
"""

# TODO(hardware-optimization): Device-aware scheduling
# - Adapt shot distribution using `DeviceRule` and calibration metadata:
#   * supports_batch / max_shots_per_job / queue policy
#   * basis-change overhead and readout-reset time per device
#   * parallel execution lanes / multiplexing constraints
#   * per-basis or per-wire setting-change cost models
# - Provide vendor-specific policies via plug-ins (e.g., ibm, braket) while
#   keeping this module policy-agnostic by accepting a cost function callback.
# - Feed back runtime metrics (segment durations, error bars) to refine weights.

    Modes
    -----
    - Explicit: When `shot_plan` is provided, returns one segment per entry.
    - Group-based: Otherwise, consumes measurement grouping metadata and
      distributes `total_shots` using `estimated_shots_per_group` as weights.

    Notes
    -----
    - Each segment carries measurement context (basis, wires, basis_map), which
      allows executors to reuse settings and batch runs efficiently.
    - Rounding is handled deterministically; the remainder is assigned to the
      last segment to preserve `sum(shots) == total_shots`.
