- Clean shutdown mechanism
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Version 3.2.0: Async Support
**Target Release**: Q3 2025
**Branch**: `feature/async-support`

#### Goals
- Full async/await support for all API methods
- Improved performance for concurrent operations
- Better resource utilization
- Backwards compatibility maintained

#### Tasks
- [ ] Create `AsyncPyAlpacaAPI` class
- [ ] Implement async versions of all methods
- [ ] Add connection pooling with aiohttp
- [ ] Implement async rate limiting

- [ ] Add comprehensive tests (20+ test cases)
- [ ] Update documentation with async examples

#### Acceptance Criteria
- All methods have async equivalents
- Proper connection pooling and reuse
- Efficient concurrent execution
- Backwards compatible (sync API still works)
- Performance improvements documented

## 🌳 Branching Strategy

```
main
  └── v3.1.0 (for WebSocket features)
       └── feature/websocket-streaming
  └── v3.2.0 (for Async support)
       └── feature/async-support
```

### Workflow
1. Create version branch from `main`
2. Create feature branches from version branch
3. Implement features with tests
4. Create PR to merge into version branch
5. Code review and testing
6. When complete, PR from version branch to `main`

## 📊 Roadmap
