> The first production-ready agent that maps biomedical concepts to the CDISC Unified Study Data Model using either commercial or open-source LLMs.

USDM Biomedical Concept Mapper is purpose-built for clinical teams who need accurate, explainable alignment between study artefacts and CDISC biomedical concepts. Our agentic workflow discovers, validates, and maps concepts end-to-end—without black-box pipelines or heavyweight infrastructure.

## What does this project do?

The [USDM Biomedical Concept Mapper](https://github.com/AI-LENS/usdm-bc-mapper) helps identify biomedical concepts for activities in USDM files:

- **Automated Mapping**: Maps activities from USDM files to standardized biomedical concepts
- **AI-Powered Search**: Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to find the best matching CDISC concepts for given activities
- **CDISC Integration**: Utilizes the latest [CDISC biomedical concepts](https://github.com/cdisc-org/COSMoS/blob/main/export/cdisc_biomedical_concepts_latest.csv) and [SDTM dataset specializations](https://github.com/cdisc-org/COSMoS/blob/main/export/cdisc_sdtm_dataset_specializations_latest.csv)
- **Batch Processing**: Processes entire USDM study files and generates mapped outputs

### Key Features

- **Multiple Search Methods**: Supports both LLM-powered exact matching and local index searching
- **Configurable AI Models**: Supports different commercial or open-source LLMs
- **Command Line Interface**: Easy-to-use CLI for batch processing and individual concept searches

## Architecture Overview

Our self-steering agent keeps the stack intentionally simple while delivering state-of-the-art accuracy. Every run goes through three explainable steps:

### Step 1 – Dynamic Retrieval
`CdiscBcIndex` builds a lightweight BM25 retriever over the latest CDISC biomedical concepts and SDTM specializations. For every prompt from the agent, it dynamically generates retrieval queries and returns a concise, templated synopsis of the top candidates.

### Step 2 – LLM Reasoning
`find_biomedical_concept` iteratively calls your chosen LLM (e.g. OpenAI, Gemini, or self-hosted open-weight models) to reason over the candidate set. The agent loop is implemented is transparent, providing explainable decision traces for each search.

### Step 3 – Deterministic USDM Mapping
`map_biomedical_concepts` enriches the USDM wrapper with the validated biomedical concept IDs, properties, and codelists. The mapper ensures every activity is linked to the correct CDISC structures and writes a ready-to-share JSON package.

**Why it works:** Retrieval keeps the LLM grounded, the reasoning step is model-agnostic, and the mapper uses CDISC-native schemas so teams get a fast, auditable pipeline without orchestrating multiple services.

## Robust Design Principles

- **Flexible LLM Integration**: Designed to work reliably with both enterprise APIs and local open-source models, providing teams with deployment flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.
- **Transparent Processing Pipeline**: Features a clear three-step workflow (retrieve, reason, map) with comprehensive audit trails and explainable decision logs for regulatory compliance.
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: Built on proven technologies including Polars for data processing, BM25 for retrieval, and the official USDM SDK—ensuring stability and maintainability.
- **Reliable Performance**: Engineered for consistent, traceable mappings that support regulatory workflows and CDISC metadata requirements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Access to LLM (commercial or open-source)

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install usdm-bc-mapper
```

## Quick Start

1. **Install the package**:

   ```bash
   pip install usdm-bc-mapper
   ```

2. **Create a config file** (`config.yaml`) in your working directory:

   ```yaml
   llm_api_key: "your-api-key-here"
   llm_model: "gpt-5-mini"
   ```

3. **Run the mapper** on your USDM file:

   ```bash
   bcm usdm your_study.json
   ```

4. **Get help** with any command:
   ```bash
   bcm --help
   bcm usdm --help
   ```

## Configuration

Before using the tool, you need to configure your settings. Create a `config.yaml` file in your working directory (the same directory where your USDM JSON file is located):

```yaml
# config.yaml
llm_api_key: "your-api-key-here"
llm_model: "gpt-5-mini" # or your preferred model

# Optional Configurations
llm_base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1" # or your custom endpoint
max_ai_lookup_attempts: 7 # max retries for AI lookup
data_path: "path/to/cdisc/data" # path to CDISC data files and system prompt for LLMs
data_search_cols: # columns to search in CDISC data
  - "short_name"
  - "bc_categories"
  - "synonyms"
  - "definition"
```

## AI SDK Compatibility

The mapper speaks the OpenAI-compatible API spec, so you can bring your own provider. See [docs/ai_sdk_compatibility.md](docs/ai_sdk_compatibility.md) for the full walkthrough; the quick-start presets are below.

**Commercial APIs**

```yaml
llm_base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
llm_api_key: "sk-your-api-key"
llm_model: "gpt-5-mini"
```

**Open-weight Aggregators**

```yaml
llm_base_url: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
llm_api_key: "sk-or-your-key"
llm_model: "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free"
```

**Self-hosted Runtimes**

```yaml
llm_base_url: "http://localhost:11434/v1"
llm_api_key: "not-needed"
llm_model: "phi4"
```

## Command Line Usage

The tool provides three main commands through the `bcm` CLI. Use `bcm --help` or `bcm <command> --help` to see detailed documentation for each command.

#### 1. Map USDM File Biomedical Concepts

Map all biomedical concepts in a USDM file to CDISC standards:

```bash
bcm usdm path/to/your/usdm_file.json --config config.yaml
```

With custom output file:

```bash
bcm usdm path/to/your/usdm_file.json --output mapped_results.json --config config.yaml
```

#### 2. Find Individual Biomedical Concept

Find CDISC match for a specific biomedical concept using LLM (provides exact matching):

```bash
bcm find-bc-cdisc "diabetes mellitus" --config config.yaml
```

#### 3. Search CDISC Biomedical Concepts

Search the local CDISC index for matching concepts (searches local index without LLM):

```bash
bcm search-bc-cdisc "blood pressure" --config config.yaml
```

Search with custom number of results:

```bash
bcm search-bc-cdisc "blood pressure" --k 20 --config config.yaml
```

**Note**: The main difference between `find-bc-cdisc` and `search-bc-cdisc` is that `find-bc-cdisc` uses an LLM to find exact matches, while `search-bc-cdisc` looks for matches in the local index.

## Advanced Usage

#### Enable Debug Logging

Add the `--show-logs` flag to any command to see detailed processing information:

```bash
bcm usdm path/to/file.json --config config.yaml --show-logs
```

## Output Examples

#### USDM Mapping Output

When using `bcm usdm`, the tool outputs the original USDM data with mapped CDISC biomedical concepts, including confidence scores and reasoning in structured JSON format.

#### Individual Concept Search Output

When using `bcm find-bc-cdisc` or `bcm search-bc-cdisc`, the tool returns matched CDISC concept details with relevance scores.
