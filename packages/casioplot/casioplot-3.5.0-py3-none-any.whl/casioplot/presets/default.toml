# ones that aren't going to be used.

# - 'global/<file_name>' if it is the global config file.
# - 'presets/<file_name>' if it is one of the preset files.
# It is necessary to put the .toml extencion.
#
# A config file can only specify files less "custom" that them, 
# following the following order of "customness" (more custom first) local > global > presets.
