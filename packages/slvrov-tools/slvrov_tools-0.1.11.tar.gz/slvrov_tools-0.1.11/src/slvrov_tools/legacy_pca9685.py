    Class allowing basic use of the PCA9685 16-Channel, 12-bit PWM Driver

        pwm_frequency (int): the frequency (Hz) that the driver will output; max is 25_000_000

        bus (int): I2C bus number; default is 1
        pwm_time (int): the time (μs) it takes to complete one PWM cycle at pwm_frequency

    Methods:
        write(register, value): writes a value to a given register on the PCA9685
        clear(): clears the MODE1 register, allowing the oscillator to start
        write_prescale(): calculates and writes the prescale that lowers the driver's clock frequency to the pwm frequency
