description: |
  TinySecretManager (TSM) is a lightweight, file-based secret management service designed to 
  securely store and manage sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and configuration 
  settings. It provides a simple interface for storing and retrieving secrets, making it easy to 
  integrate into applications and workflows. TSM is particularly useful in environments where a 
  full-fledged secret management solution is not required, but secure storage of sensitive data 
  is still necessary.
