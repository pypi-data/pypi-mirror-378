description: |
  KubeApps is a web-based UI for managing Kubernetes applications. It provides a user-friendly interface to 
  deploy, manage, and monitor applications running on Kubernetes clusters. KubeApps simplifies the management 
  of Helm charts and allows users to easily install, upgrade, and delete applications. In MLOX, it serves as 
  a convenient tool for users to interact with their Kubernetes deployments and manage applications without 
  needing to use the command line.
