About
=========

The ``cryptomatte-api`` is a fast, memory-efficient and robust library for loading, validating 
and decoding cryptomattes. It is meant to serve as a de-facto standard implementation of cryptomatte
loading that is DCC-agnostic and runs as a standalone.

It is written entirely using C++20 while also providing pre-built python binaries that are pip-installable.

Features
=========

- Robust and accurate decoding of cryptomattes (v1.2.0 spec)
- Fully compliant with the specification
- Extremely fast even at high resolutions
- Very memory efficient
- Rigorously tested

Performance
===========

The ``cryptomatte-api`` allows you to decode hundreds of cryptomattes for billions of pixels in 
less than a second. It is fast and efficient for both small and large images. During our :ref:`cmatte_benchmarks`
we test from just 320x140 pixels to 14480x8370 pixels for over 200 masks per-image.

We allow you to decode using in-memory compression or directly into a flat buffer giving you the 
flexibility to choose depending on your performance and memory needs.

Quickstart
==========

This is a simple example of getting you up and running with the cryptomatte-api, loading a file from 
disk (which validates it) and then extract one or more masks from the image.

## C++
```cpp
#include <cryptomatte/cryptomatte.h>

auto matte = cmatte::cryptomatte::load("from/disk/path", false /* load preview channels */);
auto mask = matte.mask("my_mask"); // will throw if 'my_mask' is not available
auto all_masks = matte.masks_compressed(); // get all the masks as compressed channels.
```

## Python
```py
import cryptomatte_api as cmatte

matte = cmatte.Cryptomatte.load("from/disk/path", load_preview=False)
mask = matte.mask("my_mask") # will raise if 'my_mask' is not available
all_masks = matte.masks() # get all the masks of the cryptomatte mapped by names.
```
