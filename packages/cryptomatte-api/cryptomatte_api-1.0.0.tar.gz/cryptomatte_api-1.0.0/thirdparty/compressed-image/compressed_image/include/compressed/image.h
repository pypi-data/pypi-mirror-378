	/// Compressed Image representation with easy access to different channels. Internally functions very similar to an NDArray
	/// with the important distinction that the number of dimensions is fixed to be 3-Dimensional (width, height, channels).
	/// They are laid out in scanline order with each channel being its own distinct object which may have any size.
	/// 
	/// The image is stored in a non-resizable fashion so whatever the resolution was going into it, is what the image will be.
	/// To rescale or refit the image a new `image` has to be constructed.
	/// 
	/// The data is compressed in memory and we store it as part of a blosc2 super-chunk which is essentially a 3d array of 
	/// super-chunk -> chunk -> block. Where having the block size fit into L1 cache and the Chunk size into L3 cache is desirable
	/// as each block can be handled by a single cpu core while the chunk fits well within shared L3 memory.
