A dynamically-typed compressed image composed of multiple channels, supporting
interaction with numpy arrays and efficient memory/storage via lazy compression.

Supports the following np.dtypes as fill values:
    - np.float16
    - np.float32
    - np.uint8
    - np.int8
    - np.uint16
    - np.int16
    - np.uint32
    - np.int32

The channels are stored as compressed buffers allowing for efficient traversal and decompression.

Construct a compressed image from a list of numpy arrays, converting the arrays
into compressed_image.Channel instances. The compresion settings can be controlled with 
the `compression_codec`, `compression_level`, `block_size`, `chunk_size` parameters.

:param dtype: The dtype of the image data.
:param channels: List of 2D numpy arrays representing image channels. These should have
                 the shape (height, width) storing the image data in scanline order.
:param width: Width of the image.
:param height: Height of the image.
:param channel_names: Optional list of channel names to assign.
:param compression_codec: Compression codec, defaults to lz4 which is a good compromise 
                          between compression ratio and speed usually achieving between 5-10x
                          compression ratios.
:param compression_level: Compression level, defaults to 9 for lz4 and typically ranges between 
                          0-9. For lz4 9 is usually a good value as performance doesn't suffer 
                          much from having this at its highest.
:param block_size: The block size used internally in the 3d containers, defaults to 32KB which,
                   from testing, appears to be a good all-purpose value for both performance and
                   compression ratio. This is the size of a single run of data to be compressed
                   and should roughly fit into the L1 cache of your CPU for best performance.
                   The blocks are not transparent to the user of the API, the lowest level that
                   can be accessed is `chunks`.
:param chunk_size: Chunk size used internally (next level after blocks). Defaults to `4 * 1024 * 1024`.

                   This value should be:
                   
                   - **Small enough** to allow efficient partial extraction (e.g., for region-of-interest).
                   - **Large enough** to saturate available cores when divided by `block_size`.
                   
                   These defaults are tuned for good performance on a wide range of systems.
