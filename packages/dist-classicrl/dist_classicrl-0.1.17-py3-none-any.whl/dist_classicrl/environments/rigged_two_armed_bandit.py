    """
    A rigged two-armed bandit environment where the second action is optimal.

    The environment has a single state and two actions (0 and 1). Action
    0 yields a reward of 1.0, while action 1 yields a reward of 0.0. The episode
    terminates after a fixed number of steps.

    Attributes
    ----------
    action_space : gym.spaces.Discrete
        Discrete action space with 2 possible actions (0 and 1).
    observation_space : gym.spaces.Discrete
        Discrete observation space with a single state (0).
    episode_len : int
        The number of steps after which the episode terminates.
    _t : int
        Internal step counter.

        Parameters
