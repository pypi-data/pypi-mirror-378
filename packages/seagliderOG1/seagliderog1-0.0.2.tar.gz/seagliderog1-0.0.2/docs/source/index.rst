Welcome to seagliderOG1's documentation!
======================================

SeagliderOG1 is a Python package aiming to convert seaglider basestation files into `OG1 format <https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual>`_.  At the moment, it converts variables into standard names, passes attributes and reformats to standard units.  There is some partial functionality to add sensors and attributes including calibration information.
 
We provide an example notebook to demonstrate the purpose of the various function and test datasets from Seaglider data in the Labrador Sea.
