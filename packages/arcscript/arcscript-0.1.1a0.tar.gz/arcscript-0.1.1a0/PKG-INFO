# ArcScript

ArcScript is a transpiled (source to source compiled) language that transpiles to JavaScript. It's a simple language that gets rid of JavaScript boilerplate for both regular syntax and DOM manipulation. 




## Applications

ArcScript has two main use-cases:

Developers can use it to build frontend applications blazingly fast without worrying about JavaScript boilerplate

Educators can use it as a teaching tool for children who have learnt HTML and CSS but might not be able to completely grasp Python or C. This will help them to instil passion towards Computer Science in them by allowing them to easily build their own frontend mini game with minimal code and new concepts.
## Installation

Install ArcScript with pip

```bash
  pip install arcscript
```

You can also clone it locally

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aditya-tiwari108/ArcScript.git
  cd ArcScript
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

If you installed using pip
```bash
  arcscript input.ez output.js
```

If you cloned it locally (assuming you are in the root directory of repo)
```bash
  python main.py input.ez output.js

```
