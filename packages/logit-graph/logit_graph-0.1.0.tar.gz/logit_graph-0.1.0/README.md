# Probabilistic Graph Model

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a probabilistic graph model using logistic regression to predict connections between vertices based on their attributes and interconnections. The model employs a logistic function to estimate the probability of connection between any given pair of vertices in the graph.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the notebooks used to generate the results in the paper.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the model.
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used in the experiments.

## Key Features

- Logistic regression-based graph modeling
- Vertex attribute and interconnection analysis
- Probability estimation for vertex connections

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your graph data in the appropriate format (see `data/` for examples).
2. Use the scripts in `src/` to run the model on your data.
3. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for detailed analysis and visualization.
