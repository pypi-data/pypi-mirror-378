              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Boilermaker

This project is an extremely-lightweight task-runner exclusively for __async Python__ and Azure Service Bus Queues. If you need a fully fledged task-runner which allows connecting to different backends, you should consider [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery/tree/main) instead.


## To Install

```sh
pip install "boilermaker-servicebus"
```

## How to Use

The `Boilermaker` application object requires some state (which will get sent to all handlers as the first argument upon invocation) and an authenticated ServiceBus client.

A task handler for `Boilermaker` is any async function which takes as its first argument application state and which has been registered:

```python
# This is a background task that we'll register
async def background_task1(state, somearg, somekwarg=True):
    """`state` must be first argument."""
    await state.data.get("key")
    print(state)
    print(somearg)
    print(somekwarg)

# Our task must be registered to be invocable.
boilermaker_app.register_async(background_task1, policy=...A retry policy goes here...)
```
__Note__: `Boilermaker` does not currently have a way to store or use the results of tasks, and all arguments must be JSON-serializable.

### Complete Example

For a fuller example, in our application, we may have some code like the following:

```python
from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential
from boilermaker.app import Boilermaker
from boilermaker.config import Config
# The boilermaker ServiceBus wrapper is for convenience/example
from boilermaker.service_bus import AzureServiceBus
from boilermaker import retries


# This represents our "App" object which will be passed as `state` to our handlers
class App:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data


# This is a background task that we'll register
async def background_task1(state: App, somearg, somekwarg=True):
    """`state` must be first argument."""
    await state.data.get("key")
    print(state)
    print(somearg)
    print(somekwarg)


service_bus_namespace_url = os.environ["SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE_URL"]
service_bus_queue_name = os.environ["SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE_NAME"]
conf = Config(
    service_bus_namespace_url=service_bus_namespace_url,
    service_bus_queue_name=service_bus_queue_name,
)
# We create a service bus Sender client
service_bus_client = AzureServiceBus.from_config(conf)

# Next we'll create a worker and register our task
worker = Boilermaker(App({"key": "value"}), service_bus_client=service_bus_client)
worker.register_async(background_task1, policy=retries.RetryPolicy.default())


# Finally, this will schedule the task
async def publish_task():
    await worker.apply_async(
        background_task1, "first-arg", somekwarg=False
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(publish_task())
```

In another process, we'll need to _run_ a background task worker. That looks like this:

```python
async def run_worker():
    await worker.run()
```

If we look in the logs for our other process, we should be able to see this task registered and run:

```sh
{"event": "Registered background function fn=background_task1", "level": "info", "logger": "boilermaker.app", "timestamp": "2024/12/10 15:46:54"}
{"event": "[background_task1] Begin Task sequence_number=19657", "level": "info", "logger": "boilermaker.app", "timestamp": "2024/12/10 15:52:23"}
...prints-go-here...
{"event": "[background_task1] Completed Task sequence_number=19657 in 0.00021130498498678207s", "level": "info", "logger": "boilermaker.app", "timestamp": "2024/12/10 15:52:23"}
```


## Callbacks and Chains

It is possible to register callbacks for tasks, which can run on success or failure. To schedule a task with callbacks, we have to create a task object and then set a success and/or failure callback. Finally, instead of `apply_async` we have to call `publish_task`:

```python
...see worker-instantation example above...

from boilermaker.failure import TaskFailureResult

async def a_background_task(state, param: str):
    if param == "success":
        print("Things seem to be going really well")
        return None
    elif param == "fail":
        return TaskFailureResult
    raise ValueError("Exceptions are a bummer!")


async def happy_path(state):
    print("Everything is great!")


async def sad_path(state):
    print("Everything is sad")


# We need to be sure our tasks are registered
worker.register_async(a_background_task, policy=retries.NoRetry())
worker.register_async(happy_path, policy=retries.NoRetry())
worker.register_async(sad_path, policy=retries.NoRetry())

# Now we can create a happy task and add callbacks
happy_task = worker.create_task(a_background_task, "success")

# For good measure, we'll create a sad task too
sad_task = worker.create_task(a_background_task, "uh oh!")

# This callback should get scheduled on success
happy_task >> worker.create_task(happy_path)

# It's also possible to assign tasks directly to `on_success` and `on_failure`.
# This callback should not get scheduled
sad_task.on_success = worker.create_task(happy_path)
# This callback should get scheduled
sad_task.on_failure = worker.create_task(sad_path)

# Finally, this will schedule the tasks
async def publish_task():
    await worker.publish_task(happy_task)
    # If we wait a bit we can see more clearly one task before the other
    await asyncio.sleep(4)
    await worker.publish_task(sad_task)
```

### Chains

It's also possible to `chain` tasks together, like this:

```python
async def publish_chain():
    fail = Task.si(sad_path)
    workflow = app.chain(
            Task.si(a_background_task, "success"),
            Task.si(happy_path),
            Task.si(a_background_task, "fail"),
            on_failure=fail,
        )
    await app.publish_task(workflow)
```


Here are examples of log out from running the above:

```json

```

## Retries

Retries are configured in `Boilermaker` using a `RetryPolicy`:

```python
class RetryPolicy(BaseModel):
    # Capped at this value
    max_tries: int = MAX_REASONABLE_RETRIES
    # Seconds
    delay: int = 0
    # Max seconds
    delay_max: int = MAX_BACKOFF_SECONDS
    # Mode for retrying
    retry_mode: RetryMode = RetryMode.Fixed
```

Retries are __scheduled__ only by raising a `RetryException`:

```python
def sometask(state):
    raise RetryException("Please try again!")
```

__Note__: _all_ tasks __must__ be registered with a `RetryPolicy`, but `Boilermaker` will only retry tasks that have raised a `RetryException`.

If you do not want your tasks to be retried:

- Do not throw a `RetryException` from inside of your task.
- Register them with a `NoRetry` policy: `worker.register_async(..., policy=retries.NoRetry())`

`NoRetry()` is simply a special policy where `max_tries=1`.

__Note__: `on_failure` callbacks will only be run __after all retries have been exhausted__.

### Scheduling Retries

There are three places where retries for a task can be configured:

- When initially registering a task (the task default).
- When scheduling a task (overrides the default for that invocation).
- When raising a `RetryException` with a custom policy (overrides default _if_ different).

Examples of each are included below.

#### Register Task with a Default Retry Policy

When a task has been registered, we can set a retry policy for any invocation of it:

```python
from boilermaker import retries

async def a_background_task(state, param: str):
    if param == "throwing":
        # This will retry using the *default policy* set when the task was registered
        raise retries.RetryException("We are thrown")
    return "OK"

worker.register_async(a_background_task, policy=retries.RetryPolicy.default())
```

This example works like a template for running the task. If `a_background_task` gets retried, `Boilermaker` will use the default policy to calculate its next delay and max attempts allowed.

#### Scheduling a Task with a Different Retry Policy

Sometimes we'd like to publish our task so that its retries follow a different plan than the task was originally registered with.

We can __publish__ (schedule) a particular task with a different retry policy like this:

```python
from boilermaker import retries

async def a_background_task(state, param: str):
    if param == "throwing":
        # This will retry using the RetryPolicy set
        # when *scheduling* the task (see below)
        raise retries.RetryException("We are thrown")
    return "OK"

# First we register the task
worker.register_async(a_background_task, policy=retries.RetryPolicy.default())

async def schedule_task_with_different_policy():
    new_policy=retries.RetryPolicy(
        max_tries=100, delay=2, delay_max=1000, retry_mode=retries.RetryMode.Exponential,
    )
    await worker.apply_async(a_background_task, "throwing", policy=new_policy)
```

In the above example, _this_ invocation of the task has a new retry policy, but all other invocations of this task elsewhere in our codebase will continue to use the default.


#### Raising a `RetryException` with a Different Policy

Lastly, it's also possible to request a different `RetryPolicy` from _inside_ a task:


```python
from boilermaker import retries

async def a_background_task(state, param: str):
    if param == "throwing":
        # This will retry using *THIS* RetryPolicy
        raise retries.RetryExceptionDefaultExponential("We are thrown", max_tries=42)
    return "OK"

# First we register the task
worker.register_async(a_background_task, policy=retries.RetryPolicy.default())

async def schedule_task_with_different_policy():
    new_policy=retries.RetryPolicy(
        max_tries=10, delay=20, delay_max=100, retry_mode=retries.RetryMode.Linear,
    )
    # Because the task raises a different policy, this one will get dropped in face of `RetryExceptionDefaultExponential`
    await worker.apply_async(a_background_task, "throwing", policy=new_policy)
```


## FAQ

**Where does the name come from?**

From [here](https://www.discogs.com/artist/632957-Boilermaker)

**Are You Going to Add Other Queue Services?**

No, not planning to. Consider one of the other background-task libraries.
