#  - "total_column_density": Total (H2 + heavier components) column density in
#  cm-2.
#  - "emitting_molecule_column_density": Column density of the emitting molecule in cm-2.
#  - "intensity": Intensity in Jy/beam.
#  - "tau": Opacities.

# The values of the dictionary are lists of strings indicating the operations to
# be performed over the cube. These are the available operations:
#
#  - "add_source": Add a point source at the reference pixel.
#  - "add_noise": Add Gaussian noise, defined by maxcube2noise parameter.
#  - "convolve": Convolve with a Gaussian defined by the parameters bmaj, bmin,
#  and pabeam.
#  - "moments_and_pv": Computes the moments 0, 1, and 2, the maximum intensity
#  and the PV diagram.
