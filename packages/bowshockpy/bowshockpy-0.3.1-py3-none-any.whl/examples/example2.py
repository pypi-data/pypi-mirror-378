MODEL OUTPUTS

# it does not exist, it will be created automatically.

# Dictionary indicating the desired output spectral cubes and the operations
# performed over them. The keys of the dictionary are strings indicating the
# quantities of the desired cubes. These are the available quantities of the
# spectral cubes:
#
#  - "mass": Total mass of molecular hydrogen in solar mass
#  - "total_column_density": Total (H2 + heavier components) column density in
#  cm-2.
#  - "emitting_molecule_column_density": Column density of the emitting molecule in cm-2.
#  - "intensity": Intensity in Jy/beam.
#  - "tau": Opacities.
#
# The values of the dictionary are lists of strings indicating the operations to
# be performed over the cube. These are the available operations:
#
#  - "add_source": Add a point source at the reference pixel.
#  - "add_noise": Add Gaussian noise, defined by maxcube2noise parameter.
#  - "convolve": Convolve with a Gaussian defined by the parameters bmaj, bmin,
#  and pabeam.
#  - "moments_and_pv": Computes the moments 0, 1, and 2, the maximum intensity
#  and the PV diagram.
#
# The operations will be performed folowing the order of the strings in the list
# (from left to right). The list can be left empty if no operations are desired.
#
# For example, the following dictionary for the outcubes parameter,
#
# outcubes = {

#     "opacity": [],
#     "emitting_molecule_column_density": ["convolve"],
#     "mass": [],
# }
# will save 4 spectral cubes in fits format. The first one are the intensities
# with Gaussian noise added, it will be convolved, and the moments and PV
# diagrams will be computed; the second cube will be the opacity; the third will
# be the mol_column_density, which will be convolved; and the forth cube will be
# the masses.
