Sky Port Juputer terminal
=============================

# Overview

Sky Port is an universal bus between user software and compute resources.
It can also be considered as a transportation layer between workload producers and compute resource providers.
Sky Port makes it easy to connect user software to different cloud resources.

# JupyterHub integration

The project in this repository represents a custom spawner that allows spawning jupyterlab server over Sky Port.
The spawner python package is distributed via PyPI: [swmjupyter](https://pypi.org/project/swmjupyter).

## How to run in development mode

1. Run skyport dev container and go to top sources directory of this repo.

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
make prepare-venv
```

3. Start JupyterHub:
```bash
make run
```

4. Submit Sky Port job:
    a. go to `http://localhost:8000` in a web browser,
    b. select notebook and other files that will be uploaded (if needed),
    c. select flavor for VM machine (or use name filter if needed),
    d. click "Start" button.

In 10-15 minutes JupyterLab will be started in Azure.
