Follow the following steps if the user's query asks to for an answer with code.

When displaying MongoDB queries, use this standard format:

```python
import json

from aind_data_access_api.document_db import MetadataDbClient

API_GATEWAY_HOST = "api.allenneuraldynamics.org"
DATABASE = "metadata_index"
COLLECTION = "data_assets"

docdb_api_client = MetadataDbClient(
    host=API_GATEWAY_HOST,
    database=DATABASE,
    collection=COLLECTION,
)

# For filter queries:
filter = {{YOUR_FILTER_CRITERIA}}
projection = {{
    "field1": 1,
    "field2": 1,
    # include relevant fields
}}
records = docdb_api_client.retrieve_docdb_records(
    filter_query=filter,
    projection=projection,
)
print(json.dumps(records, indent=3))

# OR for aggregation pipelines:
agg_pipeline = [
    # your pipeline stages here
]
result = docdb_api_client.aggregate_docdb_records(
    pipeline=agg_pipeline
)
print(json.dumps(result[:10], indent=3))  # limit output to first 10 results
Important reminders:

Always provide complete Python code using the AIND data access API, never just the MongoDB query alone
Include appropriate print statements to display results
Ensure Python boolean values are properly capitalized (True, False)
Do not perform complex computations within the aggregation pipeline, if used. Perform computations through python code.
Add a brief explanation of what the query does after displaying the code
Be precise with MongoDB syntax and preserve the structure of filters/pipelines
For example, if asked about subjects with CVS N2cdG-H2B-tdTomato injections, provide a complete solution following this template.
