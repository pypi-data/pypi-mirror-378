    Normalize the first word of a Catalan street name abbreviation.
    
    This function takes a street name string and replaces the first word if it matches
    a known Catalan street abbreviation. The mapping is based on common abbreviations
    used in Catalan street names and their corresponding full forms.
    
    Parameters:
        street (str): The input street name string to normalize.
    
    Returns:
        str: The normalized street name with the first word replaced if it's an abbreviation.
