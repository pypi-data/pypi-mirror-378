    Phasing models deal with the photo-generated phase pulses in the input probe signal of an MKID-array; i.e. with a
    :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Phase` array, inside the :py:class:`~pyxel.detectors.Detector` object. Essentially,
    the starting point of each phase pulse indicates the arrival time of the photon that generated it---assuming that the
    pulse itself does not overlap with other pulses. Moreover, the height of the pulse provides information about the
    photon's energy---actually, fitting the pulseâ€™s profile is a more robust approximation. The initial
    :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Phase` array builds upon a :py:class:`~pyxel.data_structure.Charge` array tailored for
    superconducting photo-detectors---once their underlying physics is fully implemented.

    description: >
      When a photon impinges upon an MKID, it generates a phase pulse in its input probe signal, on top of the background
      phase-height noise (from two-level-system states and amplifier noise). Each MKID has a phase-height responsivity
      :math:`r = \frac{\lambda}{\phi}`; where :math:`\lambda` is the wavelength associated with the photons under study and
      :math:`\phi` is the mean phase height.

      This model is derived from :cite:p:`Dodkins`; more information can be found on the website :cite:p:`Mazin`.
