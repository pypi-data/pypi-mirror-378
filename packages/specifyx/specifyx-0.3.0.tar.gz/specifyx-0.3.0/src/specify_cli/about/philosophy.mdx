# Philosophy & Attribution

## Inspiration and Attribution

This project is **inspired by and builds upon** the foundational work of the original [Spec Kit (github/spec-kit)](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) project by the GitHub team, particularly [John Lam](https://github.com/jflam) and [Den Delimarsky](https://github.com/dend). Their pioneering work in spec-driven development methodology laid the groundwork for this enhanced implementation.

## Why a Separate Project?

While deeply respecting the original specify project, SpecifyX takes a different philosophical approach in several key areas:

### 1. Installation and Distribution
- **Original specify**: Git-based templates requiring manual setup
- **SpecifyX**: Standard Python package installable via PyPI for easier adoption

### 2. Templating Capabilities 
- **Original specify**: Basic string replacement templating
- **SpecifyX**: Full Jinja2 templating with variables, loops, conditionals, and complex logic

### 3. Configuration and Customization
- **Original specify**: Minimal configuration, mostly environment-based
- **SpecifyX**: Rich TOML-based configuration system with user preferences and project-specific settings

### 4. Branch Naming Flexibility
- **Original specify**: Fixed pattern like "001-feature-name"
- **SpecifyX**: Customizable patterns to match your team's conventions AND branch validation logic so your AI assistant can't generate invalid branch names

### 5. User Experience Focus
- **Original specify**: Bash scripts with basic output
- **SpecifyX**: Customizable scripts with utils imported from specifyx to achieve user customizable scripts with low boilerplate

## Our Vision

SpecifyX aims to make spec-driven development more **accessible and powerful** for teams who want enhanced tooling while maintaining full respect for the original methodology. We believe both approaches serve different needs in the ecosystem.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development **flips the script** on traditional software development. Instead of code being king, **specifications become executable**, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.

### Core Philosophy

- **Intent-driven development** where specifications define the "_what_" before the "_how_"
- **Rich specification creation** using guardrails and organizational principles  
- **Multi-step refinement** rather than one-shot code generation from prompts
- **Heavy reliance** on advanced AI model capabilities for specification interpretation

## Development Phases

| Phase | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| **0-to-1 Development** | Generate from scratch | Generate specs → Plan implementation → Build production-ready applications |
| **Creative Exploration** | Parallel implementations | Explore diverse solutions → Support multiple tech stacks → Experiment with UX patterns |
| **Iterative Enhancement** | Brownfield modernization | Add features iteratively → Modernize legacy systems → Adapt processes |

## Enhanced Features

### Key Benefits for Users

- **Easy Installation**: Install with `uv tool install specifyx` or run `uvx specifyx` without installation
- **Powerful Templating**: Use Jinja2 templates with variables, conditionals, and loops for complex project generation
- **Flexible Branch Naming**: Customize branch patterns like `feature/{name}` or `task/{id}-{name}` and more instead of fixed formats
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Interactive menus, progress tracking, and better error messages
- **Project Generation**: Generate projects from templates with variables, conditionals, and loops for complex project generation
- **Configurable Python Scripts**: Uses python for scripts with utils imported from specifyx to achieve user customizable scripts with low boilerplate
- **Configuration System**: Save your preferences in TOML files instead of repeating command-line options

### Jinja2 Templating

In your generated project, you can see spec, plan and tasks templates in `.specify/templates/` directory. You can customize them to your needs. They will be rendered with your project variables.

### Enhanced User Interface
- Interactive menus with keyboard navigation
- Progress tracking with live updates  
- Rich console output with colored themes
- Graceful fallbacks for limited terminals

## Technical Details

For developers interested in the architecture:

- **Modern Architecture**: Modular services instead of monolithic code
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations and validation throughout
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Contract, integration, and unit tests
- **TOML Configuration**: Flexible configuration with dynaconf
