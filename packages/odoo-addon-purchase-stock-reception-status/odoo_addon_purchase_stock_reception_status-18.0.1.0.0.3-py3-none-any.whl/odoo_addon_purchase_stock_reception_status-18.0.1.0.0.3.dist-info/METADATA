This module provides compatibility between the OCA
purchase_reception_status module and Odoo's native purchase_stock
module.

When both modules are installed, this glue module automatically:

- Overrides Odoo's native receipt_status computation to use the OCA
  logic
- Hides redundant native receipt_status displays in views
- Ensures the preferred OCA logic is applied instead of Odoo's approach

Usage
=====

This module is automatically installed when both
purchase_reception_status and purchase_stock are present in the system.

No additional configuration is required. The module will automatically:

1. Override the native receipt_status computation method
2. Apply the OCA logic for calculating purchase order reception status
3. Hide duplicate receipt_status fields in views to avoid confusion

The purchase order will continue to display the receipt_status field
with values "pending", "partial", and "full", but computed using the OCA
logic.

Users can continue to use the force_received flag to manually mark
orders as fully received when needed.
