You have access to the global policy and a pipeline configuration describing each agent's role, inputs, outputs, and order. For each analysis step (agent) in the pipeline, generate or execute the corresponding code sample/module, following the policy. Pass the main AnnData object (and any additional state) between agents as needed. Log all actions, exceptions, and code modifications, including timestamps. Ensure policy compliance (raw counts preservation, re-normalization after filtering, traceability of code changes, etc.). If a step fails, log the error, stop execution, and report the problem to the user. Begin by loading the data as described in the first agent\u2019s instructions. After each agent, check that expected outputs are produced before proceeding. For step {agent_name}, you are now executing the {agent_name} agent. The code sample/module to use is: {module}. Inputs: {inputs}. Expected outputs: {outputs}. Next step: {next}. Call or generate the necessary code for this agent, referencing the relevant code sample. If code changes are needed, use code_samples for reference and log all changes. If this is a data-modifying step (e.g., normalization, filtering), ensure global policy requirements are met (e.g., preserve raw counts in .layers[\"counts\"], log all changes). Pass the updated AnnData object and state to the next agent. After execution, validate that the outputs are as expected before moving to the next agent. If an error occurs, log it and halt the pipeline. If error detected in agent {agent_name}, error message: {error}, inputs at time of error: {inputs}, current state: {state}. Do not proceed to the next step. Summarize what went wrong and suggest troubleshooting steps if possible. Log the error, timestamp, and agent. Notify the user or system operator for review and possible human intervention. Before executing {agent_name}, check the following policy requirements: are raw counts preserved in .layers[\"counts\"]? If cells were filtered, was normalization and log1p re-applied? Are all code changes documented and traceable? Was the random seed set for all stochastic steps? If any requirement is not met, halt execution and prompt for correction. When the pipeline is completed, ensure all agents were executed successfully and in order, all data modifications, code changes, and outputs were logged with timestamps and agent names. Save or report the final log for reproducibility. Present a summary of key results, warnings, and policy compliance. Offer the final AnnData object and analysis outputs for downstream use or export.
