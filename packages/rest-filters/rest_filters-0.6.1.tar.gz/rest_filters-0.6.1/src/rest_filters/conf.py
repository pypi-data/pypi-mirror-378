    There are a few settings that change how ``rest-filters`` behaves globally.
    Most of these settings can also be changed on a per-FilterSet basis.

    You can use these settings by adding the ``REST_FILTERS`` setting to your
    Django configuration file. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        REST_FILTERS = {
            "BLANK": "keep",
            "KNOWN_PARAMETERS": ["page", "page_size"],
        }
    """

    BLANK: Literal["keep"] | Literal["omit"] = "omit"
    """
    Determines how empty query parameters are handled. Default is ``omit``
    which behaves as if query parameter was not provided. Setting this to
    ``keep`` will cause empty values to be parsed by the related field.
    """
    KNOWN_PARAMETERS: list[str] = notset  # type: ignore[assignment]
    """
    A list of query parameters that are not defined in FilterSet but otherwise
    used by other mechanisms, such as pagination.

    By default, the following query parameters are marked as known:

    - page
    - page_size
    - cursor
    - ``api_settings.ORDERING_PARAM``
    - ``api_settings.VERSION_PARAM``
    - ``api_settings.URL_FORMAT_OVERRIDE``
    """
    HANDLE_UNKNOWN_PARAMETERS: bool = True
    """
    Decides whether to handle unknown parameters.
    """
    DEFAULT_GROUP: str = "chain"
    """
    The default group for filters. By default, this is set to the reserved
    group ``chain``, which will chain ``filter()`` calls for each resolved
    query expression.
