# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of Agent Control Hub:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

**Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This could put other users at risk.

### 2. Report privately

Please report security vulnerabilities privately by:

- **Email**: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) (replace with actual email)
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- **Direct message**: Contact maintainers directly

### 3. Include the following information

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### 4. Response timeline

We will:

- **Acknowledge** your report within 48 hours
- **Investigate** the issue within 7 days
- **Provide updates** on our progress
- **Release a fix** as soon as possible
- **Credit you** (if desired) in our security advisories

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update your dependencies
- **Use environment variables**: Store API keys and secrets in environment variables, not in code
- **Review generated code**: Always review AI-generated code before deployment
- **Use virtual environments**: Isolate your projects using virtual environments
- **Regular backups**: Keep backups of important projects
- **Monitor logs**: Check logs regularly for suspicious activity

### For Developers

- **Input validation**: Always validate user inputs
- **Sanitize outputs**: Sanitize all outputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Secure API keys**: Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for API communications
- **Regular updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
- **Security testing**: Include security testing in your development process

## Known Security Considerations

### API Key Management

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **Rotate keys regularly** for better security
- **Use least privilege** principle for API key permissions

### Generated Code

- **Review all generated code** before execution
- **Run in isolated environments** when possible
- **Be cautious with file operations** and system commands
- **Validate inputs** in generated code

### Network Security

- **Use HTTPS** for all external API calls
- **Validate SSL certificates** for secure connections
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Monitor for suspicious activity**

## Security Measures in Place

### Code Security

- **Dependency scanning**: Regular scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static analysis**: Code analysis for security issues
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Output sanitization**: Sanitization of all outputs

### Runtime Security

- **Environment isolation**: Virtual environments for project isolation
- **File system restrictions**: Limited file system access
- **Process isolation**: Isolated execution environments
- **Resource limits**: CPU and memory limits

### API Security

- **Input validation**: All inputs are validated
- **Rate limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Error handling**: Secure error messages
- **Logging**: Comprehensive security logging

## Vulnerability Disclosure

When we discover or are notified of a security vulnerability:

1. **Immediate assessment** of the vulnerability
2. **Development of a fix** as quickly as possible
3. **Testing** of the fix in a secure environment
4. **Release** of the fix with security advisory
5. **Communication** with affected users
6. **Post-mortem** and process improvement

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:

- **Patch releases** for critical vulnerabilities
- **Minor releases** for important security improvements
- **Security advisories** for detailed information
- **Documentation updates** for security best practices

## Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
- **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's security advisory feature
- **Issues**: Create a private issue for non-critical security questions
