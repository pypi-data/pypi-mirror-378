# AgentHub: Next Steps and Future Improvement Recommendations

## 1. Immediate Next Steps

### a. **Add LLM API Abstraction**
- Refactor your agent code to allow easy swapping of LLM providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Together, OpenRouter, HuggingFace, local Llama, etc.).
- Use a configuration file or environment variable to select the active provider.
- Abstract LLM calls into a module/class (e.g., `llm_provider.py`) to standardize chat/completion calls.

### b. **Integrate Free LLM API Aggregators**
- Add support for Together.ai and OpenRouter.ai as first-class LLM providers.
- Update the agent system to use OpenAI-compatible APIs for these services.
- Allow users to provide their aggregator API keys via `.env` or UI.

### c. **Improve Prompt Engineering for Tool Use**
- Fine-tune prompts for open models to reinforce "tool use only" and structured outputs (e.g., file plans, no code blocks).
- Maintain/expand iterative repair logic for static analysis feedback.

### d. **Add a LICENSE File**
- Choose and add an open-source license to your repository (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).

### e. **Implement Repo-Level Automated Testing**
- Add unittests for core orchestration logic, API endpoints, and agent cooperation.
- Set up GitHub Actions or another CI tool for automated test runs and linting.

## 2. Future Improvements

### a. **User and Admin Experience**
- Add a UI or config for selecting the LLM provider/model per project/session.
- Allow custom agent instructions or constraints via UI or config.

### b. **Hybrid Local/Cloud LLM Support**
- If local Llama is available, offer hybrid selection: default to local, fallback to cloud API if needed (e.g., for larger prompts or more advanced models).

### c. **Advanced Error Handling and Logging**
- Expose more granular error reasons for pipeline step failures in the UI/logs.
- Include logs of all LLM/model responses for auditing and debugging.

### d. **Extensibility and Plugin System**
- Document how to extend the agent pipeline with new agent roles or tools.
- Consider a plugin pattern for adding new LLM providers or agent behaviors.

### e. **Advanced Agent Features**
- Enable agents to “learn” from prior repair attempts (feed previous errors into next prompt).
- Support for richer code projects by optionally relaxing stdlib-only restrictions.

### f. **Community and Contribution**
- Encourage early users to file issues and PRs.
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md and a Code of Conduct for open source best practices.

## 4. Concluding Recommendations

- **Modularize and abstract all LLM-related logic** for easy future swaps.
- **Leverage free aggregator APIs** for experimentation and cost control.
- **Focus on prompt engineering and repair logic** for best results with open models.
- **Invest in CI and repository hygiene** (license, tests, contribution docs).
- **Stay current**: Watch for improvements in open-source models and aggregator APIs.
