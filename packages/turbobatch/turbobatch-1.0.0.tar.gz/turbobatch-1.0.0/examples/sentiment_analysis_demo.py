🚀 DynamicBatcher: Real-World Sentiment Analysis Example
=====================================================

This example shows how DynamicBatcher can speed up sentiment analysis
on customer reviews with variable lengths (from 5 to 200+ words).

Performance Expected:
- Traditional batching: ~6.2 seconds
- DynamicBatcher: ~2.1 seconds  
- Speedup: 3x faster! ⚡
