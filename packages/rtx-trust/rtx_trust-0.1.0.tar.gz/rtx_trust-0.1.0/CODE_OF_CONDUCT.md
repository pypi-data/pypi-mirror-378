# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as community members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in Real Tracker X a harassment-free experience for everyone. We commit to building an inclusive, safe, and collaborative project that honors the work of Author Andreas Fahl and every contributor.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy, kindness, and respect toward all people.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the project and the community.
- Showing gratitude for the time and effort invested by contributors.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments.
- Publishing private information without explicit permission.
- Personal attacks, trolling, or deliberate disruption of discussions.
- Any conduct that violates applicable laws or ethical norms.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying expectations and taking appropriate corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior. Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, discussions, pull requests, and community media. It also applies when individuals are representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers listed in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md). All complaints will be reviewed promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines
1. **Correction.** A private, written warning that clarifies expectations.
2. **Warning.** A formal warning with potential consequences for continued behavior.
3. **Temporary Ban.** Removal from project spaces for a defined period.
4. **Permanent Ban.** Removal from all project spaces for severe or repeated violations.
