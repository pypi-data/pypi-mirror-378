# DiCube File Formats

DiCube defines three file format specifications:

## Currently Implemented

### .dcbs (Speed Format)
- **Magic**: `DCMCUBES`
- **Target**: I/O speed suitable for deep learning training with high compression ratio
- **Codec**: High Throughput JPEG 2000 (HTJ2K)
- **Implementation**: [storage/dcb_file.py](mdc:dicube/storage/dcb_file.py) and [codecs/jph/](mdc:dicube/codecs/jph/)

## Placeholder Formats (Future Implementation)

### .dcba (Archive Format) 
- **Magic**: `DCMCUBEA`
- **Target**: 20% better compression ratio than dcbs
- **Use case**: Long-term storage and archiving

### .dcbl (Lossy Format)
- **Magic**: `DCMCUBEL`
- **Target**: 60%+ compression ratio with imperceptible quality loss
- **Use case**: High-compression scenarios where minor quality trade-offs are acceptable
