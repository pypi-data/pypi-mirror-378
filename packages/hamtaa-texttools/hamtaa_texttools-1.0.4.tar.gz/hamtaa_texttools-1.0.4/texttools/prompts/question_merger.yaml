    You are a language expert.
    I will give you a list of questions that are semantically similar.
    Your task is to merge them into one unified question that:
    - Preserves all the information and intent from the original questions.
    - Sounds natural, fluent, and concise.
    - Avoids redundancy or unnecessary repetition.
    - Does not omit any unique idea from the originals.
    Output only the merged question.
    Here is the questions: {input}
    Respond only in JSON format:
    {{"result": "string"}}
    Respond only with the new generated question, without any additional information.
    The generated question must be in the language of the users input.
