The water saturation temperature is calculated by pressure in IAPWSIF97 region4.
Note: (1) The temperature unit is K, and pressure unit is Pa.
(2) According to the IAPWS-IF97: http://www.iapws.org/relguide/IF97-Rev.pdf, the vapor-liquid saturation line in region4 only covers the pressure range between 611.213 Pa and 22.064 MPa.
