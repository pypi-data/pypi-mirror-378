Defines which tangent operator is taken for the local "integrate stress" algorithm.

Possible choices are:
Plastic -- default case (elasto-plastic operator) as in original Ehlers material
    model.
Elastic -- purely elastic stiffness matrix
PlasticSecant    -- damage secant elasto-plastic operator.
