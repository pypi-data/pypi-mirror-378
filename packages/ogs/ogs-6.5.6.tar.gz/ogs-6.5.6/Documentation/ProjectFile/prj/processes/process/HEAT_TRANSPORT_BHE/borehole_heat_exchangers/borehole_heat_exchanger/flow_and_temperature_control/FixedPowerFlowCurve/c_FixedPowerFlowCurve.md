It represents that the BHE has the fixed power and the flow rate in pipes is various with time given as a curve. It is kind of another BHE boundary condition to calculate the temperature difference between inlet and outlet fluid. With this BHE boundary condition, the flow rate of circulating fluid is various and inflow temperature is calculated by the heat load, flow rate at particular time and the outflow temperature got from the previous time step.
