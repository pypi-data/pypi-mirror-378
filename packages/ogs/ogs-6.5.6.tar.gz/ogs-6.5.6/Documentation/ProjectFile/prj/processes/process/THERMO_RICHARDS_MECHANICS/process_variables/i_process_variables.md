The process variables for temperature, pressure and displacement.

If higher order elements (order=2) are chosen for the displacement variable,
 the linear elements (order=1) have to be used for the temperature and
 the pressure variables. That means to use the Talyor-Hood elements.

If the linear elements (order=1) are used for displacement variable,
 they are used for temperature and the pressure variables as well.
