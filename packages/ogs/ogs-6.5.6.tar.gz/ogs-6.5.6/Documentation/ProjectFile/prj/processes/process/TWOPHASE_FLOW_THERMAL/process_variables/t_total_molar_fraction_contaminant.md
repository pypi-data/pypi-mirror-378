Total molar fraction of the organic contaminant, defined as
\f[
X^c=\frac{S_LN_Lx^c_L+(1-S_L)N_Gx^c_G}{S_LN_L+(1-S_L)N_G},
\f]
where \f$S_L\f$ and \f$S_G\f$ are the liquid and gas phase saturatons,
\f$N_L\f$ and \f$N_G\f$ are the liquid and gas phase molar densities,
\f$x^c_L\f$ and \f$x^c_G\f$ are the contaminant molar fractions in the liquid
and gas phases.
