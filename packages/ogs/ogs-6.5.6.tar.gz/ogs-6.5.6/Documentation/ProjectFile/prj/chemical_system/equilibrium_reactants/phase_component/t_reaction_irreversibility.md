This is an optional keyword to specify if the phase component should be allowed to precipitate or dissolve only. There are three allowed cases:

- Default: skip the tag and the phase component will be allowed to dissolve and precipitate (reversible reaction).

- Precipitate only: Enter `precipitate_only` to only allow precipitation of phase (irreversible precipitation reaction).

- Dissolve only: Enter `dissolve_only` to only allow dissolution of phase (irreversible dissolution reaction).
