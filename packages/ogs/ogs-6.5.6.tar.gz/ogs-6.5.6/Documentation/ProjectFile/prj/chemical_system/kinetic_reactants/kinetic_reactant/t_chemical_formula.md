An optional tag to define a list of chemical formulas followed by corresponding stoichiometric coefficients, e.g., KAlMg3Si3O10(OH)2 0.8 KFe3AlSi3O10(OH)2 0.2. It means that consuming one mole of the custom kinetic reactant leaves 0.8 mole KAlMg3Si3O10(OH)2 and 0.2 mole KFe3AlSi3O10(OH)2 dissolved.
