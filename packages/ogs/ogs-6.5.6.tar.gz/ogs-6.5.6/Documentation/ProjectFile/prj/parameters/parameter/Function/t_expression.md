Mathematical expression of a function.
For non-scalar values, an expression should be given for each component.

Currently x,y,z, and t are supported variables, and curves from the `<curves>`
section can be called using their names.  A curve is a single argument function
and can be used in an expression like `curveA(sin(t))`.
