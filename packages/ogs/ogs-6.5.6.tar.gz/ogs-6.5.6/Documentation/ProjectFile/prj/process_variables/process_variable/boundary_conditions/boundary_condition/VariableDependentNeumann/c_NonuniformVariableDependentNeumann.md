Declares a Neumann boundary condition for a two variable process that is non-uniform in space and depending on both variable values on the mesh nodes of the boundary mesh.
The flux consists of 4 summands: 1) a constant flux, 2) a flux depending on the process variables value at the mesh node, 3) a flux depending on the other variables value at the mesh node and 3) a flux depending on the product of both variables at the mesh node.
If the Newton-Raphson method is applied for the global system, please select the numerical Jacobian calculation.
