"""**ALPHA** This module represents the Gitlab CI [Service](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#services) keyword.

The services keyword defines a Docker image that runs during a job linked to the Docker image that the image keyword defines.
This allows you to access the service image during build time.

Currently this module is an unfinished prototype.
