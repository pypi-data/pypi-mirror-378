    Objects of this class are not meant to be altered. This is because Image objects are typically be defined
    at a central place and often re-used. Altering the object at one place may lead to unpredictable changes
    at any reference to that object. That is this class has no setter methods. However you can use  the
    `.with_tag()` and `.with_entrypoint()` methods on an Image object, which will return an altered copy
    of that image. Thus you can re-use a centrally maintained Image object and modify it for just the
    place you are using the altered image (copy).

    Args:
        name (str): The fully qualified image name. Could include repository and tag as usual.
