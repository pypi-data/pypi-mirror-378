"""This module represents the Gitlab CI [needs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#needs) keyword.

Needs are to create relationships between `gcip.core.job.Job`s and `gcip.core.sequence.Sequence`s, which will
then be executed as early as all preceding required jobs finished. This relationship ignores the common ordering by stages.

You do not have to use the `Need` class, when simply linking`gcip.core.job.Job`s as well as `gcip.core.sequence.Sequence`s
together. When putting jobs and sequences into the `add_needs()` methods, they were translated into `Need`s internally:

```
my_job = Job(stage="example", script="do-something.sh")
my_sequence = Sequence()
...
my_next_job = Job(stage="example", script="do-anything.sh")
my_next_job.add_needs(my_job, my_sequence)

my_next_sequence = Sequence()
my_next_sequence.add_needs(my_job, my_sequence)
```

In this example `my_next_job` and `my_next_sequence` start as soon as

* `my_job` has finished
* all jobs within the last stage of `my_sequence` have finished

That also mean that stages are ignored, as the `example` stage for example.

However you have to use the `Need` class directly when depending on other pipelines jobs or for further configuration of the need,
like not [downloading artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifact-downloads-with-needs) from preceding jobs:

```
my_job.add_needs(
    Need("awesome-job", project="master-pipeline"),
    Need(my_job, artifacts=False),
    )
```

You can use `Need` with the `pipeline` parameter, to either download artifacts from a parent pipeline or to
mirror the status from an upstream pipeline. Please refer to the official documentation for examples:

* [Artifact downloads to child pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#artifact-downloads-to-child-pipelines)
* [Mirror the status from upstream pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#complex-trigger-syntax-for-multi-project-pipelines)

        The `needs` key-word adds a possibility to allow out-of-order Gitlab CI jobs.
        A job which needed another job runs directly after the other job as finished successfully.

        Args:
            job (str | None): The name of the job to depend on. Could be left is `pipeline` is set. Defaults to None which requires
                `pipeline` to be set.
            project (str | None): If the `job` resides in another pipeline you have to give its project name here. Defaults to None.
            ref (str | None): Branch of the remote project to depend on. Defaults to None.
            pipeline (str | None): When $CI_PIPELINE_ID of another pipeline is provided, then artifacts from this
                pipeline were downloaded. When the name of an `other/project` is provided, then the status of an
                upstream pipeline is mirrored. Defaults to None, which requires `job` to be set.
            artifacts (bool): Download artifacts from the `job` to depend on. Defaults to True.
            optional (bool | None): To need a job that sometimes does not exist in the pipeline, add `optional: true` to the needs configuration.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If neither `job` nor `pipeline` is set.
