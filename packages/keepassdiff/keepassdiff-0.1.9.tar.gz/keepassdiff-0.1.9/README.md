# KeePassDiff

I started using KeePass back in 2021 and I have been using it since then to store my passwords. But I didn't set up a proper way to sync the database between my devices. So I ended up with multiple databases with different passwords and entries. I wanted to sort of **diff the databases and merge them** into one, like git diff -- resolving conflicts, reverting, etc. Well, KeePass doesn't provide a way to diff two databases. Hence this project.

## Usage

1. Open two KeePass databases in diff.
2. See the differences and conflicting entries between the two databases.
3. Then using merge left, merge right options decide which entries or groups to keep and which to discard.
4. Finally, export the merged database.

## Installation

```bash
pip install keepassdiff
```

Run `kpd` or `kpdiff` to run the tool.
