gym-saturation
==============

``gym-saturation`` is a collection of `Gymnasium
<https://gymnasium.farama.org/>`__ environments for reinforcement
learning (RL) agents guiding saturation-style automated theorem
provers (ATPs) based on the `given clause algorithm
<https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2018.0034#d3e468>`__.

There are two environments in ``gym-saturation`` following the same
API: `SaturationEnv
<https://gym-saturation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/saturation-env.html>`__:
``VampireEnv`` --- for `Vampire
<https://github.com/vprover/vampire>`__ prover, and ``IProverEnv``
--- for `iProver <https://gitlab.com/korovin/iprover/>`__.

``gym-saturation`` can be interesting for RL practitioners willing to
apply their experience to theorem proving without coding all the
logic-related stuff themselves.

In particular, ATPs serving as ``gym-saturation`` backends
incapsulate parsing the input formal language (usually, one of the
`TPTP <https://tptp.org/>`__ (Thousands of Problems for Theorem
Provers) library), transforming the input formulae to the `clausal
normal form
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form>`__, and logic
inference using rules such as `resolution
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)>`__ and
`superposition
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_calculus>`__.

How to Install
==============

.. attention:: If you want to use ``VampireEnv`` you should have a
   Vampire binary on your machine. For example, download the
   latest `release
   <https://github.com/vprover/vampire/releases/tag/v4.8casc2023>`__.

   To use ``IProverEnv``, please download a stable iProver 
   `release
   <https://gitlab.com/inpefess/iprover/-/releases/2023.07.13>`__ or build it from `this commit <https://gitlab.com/korovin/iprover/-/commit/11831c13057ff984e62c8acb7226288e7092797a>`__.

The best way to install this package is to use ``pip``:

.. code:: sh

   pip install gym-saturation

Another option is to use ``conda``:

.. code:: sh

   conda install -c conda-forge gym-saturation
   
One can also run it in a Docker container (pre-packed with
``vampire`` and ``iproveropt`` binaries):

.. code:: sh

   docker build -t gym-saturation https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation.git
   docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 --name gym-saturation -d gym-saturation

and navigate to `<http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/example.py>`__ in
your browser.

How to use
==========

One can use ``gym-saturation`` environments as any other Gymnasium environment:

.. code:: python

  import gym_saturation
  import gymnasium

  env = gymnasium.make("Vampire-v0")  # or "iProver-v0"
  # skip this line to use the default problem
  env.set_task("a-TPTP-problem-filename")
  observation, info = env.reset()
  terminated, truncated = False, False
  while not (terminated or truncated):
      # apply policy
      action = ...
      observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(str(action))
  env.close()

Have a look at the basic `tutorial <https://gym-saturation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html>`__.
