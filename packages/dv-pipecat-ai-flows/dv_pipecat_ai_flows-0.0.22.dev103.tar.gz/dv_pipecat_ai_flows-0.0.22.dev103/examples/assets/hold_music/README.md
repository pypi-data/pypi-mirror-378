# Hold Music Player

This project is a hold music player, based on the `wav_audio_send` example from the [daily-python repository](https://github.com/daily-co/daily-python/blob/main/demos/audio/wav_audio_send.py). It is designed to serve as a helper for other examples, providing a reusable component for scenarios that require hold music functionality.

The hold music WAV file used in this example was sourced from [No Copyright Music](https://www.no-copyright-music.com/).

To see this hold music player in action, check out the [warm transfer example](../warm_transfer.py).
