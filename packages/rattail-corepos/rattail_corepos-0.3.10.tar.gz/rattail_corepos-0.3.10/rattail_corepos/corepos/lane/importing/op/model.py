"operational" model importers for CORE Lane

.. warning::
   All classes in this module are "direct DB" importers, which will
   write directly to MySQL.  They are meant to be used in dry-run mode
   only, and/or for sample data import to a dev system etc.  They are
   *NOT* meant for production use, as they will completely bypass any
   CORE business rules logic which may exist.
