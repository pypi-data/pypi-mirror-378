## Tips for Custom Prompts

### Structure Your Data Clearly
- Use consistent formatting for your data points
- Include clear labels for categories/time periods
- Specify the chart type you want (pie, bar, line)

### Good Prompt Pattern
```
[Chart Type] + [Title/Context] + [Data Points]

Example:
"Create a bar chart for Q2 sales results:
- April: $50K
- May: $65K  
- June: $72K"
```

### Data Formatting Tips
- **Percentages**: Use % symbol or specify "out of 100"
- **Currency**: Include $ or currency symbol
- **Time series**: Use consistent date/time formats
- **Categories**: Keep names short and clear

### Advanced Features
You can also specify:
- Custom titles: "titled 'My Custom Chart'"
- Specific colors: "using blue and green colors"
- Different themes: "with dark theme"

## Try Your Own

Now that you've seen these examples, try creating your own prompts! The tool works best when you:

1. **Clearly specify the chart type** (pie, bar, line)
2. **Provide well-structured data**
3. **Use descriptive labels**
4. **Keep data sets reasonably sized** (5-15 data points work best)

Have fun exploring different visualizations with your own data!
