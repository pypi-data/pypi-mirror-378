    "# Numerical integration for depth-dependent problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In geotechnical engineering, we are often interested in how certain properties accumulate over depth. Examples are the calculation of vertical effective stress from effective unit weight, pile shaft resistance from unit skin friction, ...\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ I(z) = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} f(z) dz $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the soil is uniform, evaluating the integral analytically is still possible and the solution is straightforward. However, when the soil is layered, or the function $ f(z) $ shows complex variations with depth, this problem becomes hard to solve analytically. Furthermore, we are often interested to know the value of the integral as the depth increases (e.g. for knowing when the pile tip is deep enough to have sufficient shaft resistance).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",

    "We this need to have a calculation method for evaluating the integral which returns the numerical value of the integral at a large number of depths. To achieve this, we can approximate the function $ f(z)$ in a given interval $ (a, b) $ with a linear function as shown in Figure 1. The integral in that interval can then be expressed as:\n",

    "Being able to apply the trapezoid rules to arrays of depth values and corresponding geotechnical parameters at those depths is very useful in geotechnical calculations. While the standard SciPy syntax can always be used, the ``CalculationGrid`` in ``groundhog`` uses the same functionality to quickly apply numerical integration to soil profiles. Using this syntax, advanced geotechnical workflows can be created with just a few lines of code.\n",
