    "# Tutorial - Basic use of groundhog functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```groundhog``` library contains geotechnical functions was built around the following core principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Transparency: Each function needs to be documented extensively and the user should always know which parameters to enter\n",
    "   - Validation: When expert knowledge or calibration to experiments dictates that parameters cannot vary outside a certain range, the calculation should be prevented. At the same time, the user should be able to override this behaviour when extrapolation is required\n",
    "   - Testing: Each function should be checked before being released. When new versions are released, the unit test suite is reperformed to ensure that code changes don't break previous functionality\n",
    "   - Convergence: Contributions to ```groundhog``` are essential, both in terms of introducing new functions as in comments, checks and feedback on the previous ones. For this reason, ```groundhog``` is managed on Github. \n",
    "   \n",
    "This notebook contains a short introduction to ```groundhog``` and shows how these core principles are reflected in the code."
