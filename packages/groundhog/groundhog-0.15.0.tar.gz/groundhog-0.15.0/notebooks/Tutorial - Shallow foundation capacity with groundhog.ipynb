    "The analysis of shallow foundation is a recurring task for geotechnical engineers. While the problem at hand is rather simple (estimating the ultimate capacity of a foundation on soil) the governing equations contain several factors to account for foundation shape, depth, inclination and load inclination. Moreover, the interaction between horizontal and vertical load adds some complexity to the problem, especially for eccentrically loaded footings.\n",
