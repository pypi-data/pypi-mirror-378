# Be part of a larger ecosystem
# Allow other packages to extend structlogging.*
# Enable modular installation of components

# ðŸ’¡ Modern Alternative:
# Python 3.3+ has implicit namespace packages - just don't include __init__.py files in namespace directories and it works automatically! Much cleaner. ðŸš€
# This was essentially the "old way" of doing what modern Python now does automatically.

# try:
#     __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)
