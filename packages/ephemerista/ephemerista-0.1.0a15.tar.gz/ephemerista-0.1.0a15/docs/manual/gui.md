```

### Asset Tracking Configuration

Ephemerista supports advanced antenna tracking where assets can automatically point their antennas toward other assets or constellation members. This feature is essential for maintaining communication links between spacecraft and ground stations.

#### Configuring Tracking in the GUI

In the **Assets** tab of the scenario configuration:

1. **Navigate to Antenna Tracking Configuration**: Found at the bottom of each asset's configuration panel
2. **Set Pointing Error**: Define the tracking accuracy in degrees (typical values: 0.1° for high-precision systems, 0.5-1.0° for standard systems)
3. **Select Tracked Assets**: Choose individual assets from the list that this asset's antennas should track
4. **Select Tracked Constellations**: Choose constellations to track any member spacecraft

```{figure} images/gui/ephemerista-web-tracking-config.png
:alt: A screenshot of the tracking configuration

Tracking configuration
```

:::{admonition} Concurrent Access Handling
:class: warning

When multiple tracked assets are simultaneously visible and communicating with the tracking asset, Ephemerista currently assumes perfect tracking of all targets. This is physically impossible in reality, as a single antenna can only point at one target at a time. Future versions will implement prioritization logic to handle these scenarios more realistically by:

- Selecting the highest priority target based on link margin, data rate, or user-defined criteria
- Modeling switching time between targets
- Accounting for lost communication during antenna repointing
  :::

### Areas of Interest

Define geographic regions for coverage analysis:

1. Click "Add Area of Interest" in the Areas of Interest section
2. Use the interactive drawing tool to create rectangular areas on the map
3. Click "Draw Rectangle" and use click-and-drag to define the area
4. Configure area parameters:
   - **Name**: Descriptive identifier for the area
   - **Minimum Elevation**: Minimum satellite elevation angle (degrees)
   - **Discretization**: Grid resolution in degrees for coverage calculations
5. Save the drawn area

```{figure} images/gui/ephemerista-web-draw-aoi.png
:alt: A screenshot of the AOI drawing dialog

**Time Spans**

- Shorter analysis periods run faster
- For initial testing, use 1-3 day periods
- Extended coverage analysis may require 30+ days

**Discretization Resolution**

- Coverage analysis: Start with resolution >1 deg
- Increase resolution only after verifying scenario setup

### Accurate Results

**TLE Data Currency**

- Use recent TLE data for accurate tracking
- TLEs degrade over time, especially for low Earth orbits

**Ground Station Placement**

- Consider local terrain and obstructions
- Use realistic minimum elevation angles (5-15°)

**Communication System Modeling**

- Verify antenna patterns match hardware specifications
- Include realistic system noise temperatures
- Account for pointing losses and weather effects

### Workflow Efficiency

**Incremental Development**

- Start with simple scenarios and add complexity gradually
- Use predefined orbit types (LEO, MEO, GEO, SSO) for initial setup
- Test each component before adding the next
- Take advantage of auto-save to experiment safely

**Data Validation**

- Review propagated orbits in the 3D Visualisation tab
- Check ground station visibility makes sense geographically
- Verify communication coverage matches mission requirements
- Use help tooltips to understand parameter impacts

**Result Verification**

- Compare results across different analysis types
- Cross-check with known mission parameters or benchmarks
- Export data to CSV for detailed analysis in external tools
- Use interactive visualization to explore edge cases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
