        Args:
            game_title (str): The title of the game sending the force actions
                command. Must match the current client's game title.

    This class extends AbstractHandlerNeuroServerClient by adding
    concrete implementations for action registration, unregistration,
    and tracking. It maintains an in-memory registry of all registered
    actions for the current game session.

    Key Features:
        - **Action Registry**: Maintains a dictionary mapping action names to Action objects
        - **Dynamic Management**: Supports runtime addition and removal of actions
        - **Session Isolation**: Actions are cleared between game sessions
        - **Duplicate Handling**: Automatically handles action name conflicts by replacement

    Attributes:
        actions (dict[str, Action]): Registry mapping action names to their
            corresponding Action objects. Updated dynamically as actions are
            registered and unregistered during the game session.

    Storage Behavior:
        - Actions are stored by name as the dictionary key
        - Registering an action with an existing name replaces the previous action
        - Unregistering non-existent actions is silently ignored
        - All actions are cleared when a new game session starts

    Note:
        - This class still requires subclasses to implement abstract methods
          from parent classes (e.g., ``add_context``, ``choose_force_action``)
        - The action registry persists throughout a single game session
        - Memory usage scales with the number of registered actions

        websocket (WebSocketConnection): The trio-websocket connection instance

    Connection Lifecycle:
        1. WebSocket connection established externally and passed to constructor
        2. Client uses connection for bidirectional message exchange
        3. Connection errors propagate to calling code for handling

    Architecture:

        - Maintains a weak reference to prevent memory leaks
        - Forwards context and action requests to the server for AI processing

    This class provides the core WebSocket server infrastructure for
    hosting Neuro AI game integration services. It manages client
    connections, handles the WebSocket protocol, and defines the
    interface for AI-powered game interaction capabilities.

    Key Features:
        - **Multi-Client Management**: Handles multiple simultaneous game client connections
        - **Structured Concurrency**: Built on Trio's async framework for reliable task management
        - **WebSocket Server**: Complete WebSocket server implementation with SSL support
        - **AI Integration Interface**: Abstract methods for connecting to Neuro AI systems
        - **Connection Lifecycle**: Automatic client registration, cleanup, and error handling

    Architecture:
        - Serves as the central coordination point for multiple game clients
        - Delegates AI operations to concrete implementations via abstract methods
        - Manages WebSocket connections and protocol handling automatically
        - Provides logging infrastructure for monitoring and debugging

    Attributes:
        clients (dict[str, TrioNeuroServerClient]): Registry of active client
            connections, keyed by remote address (IP:port format). Updated
            automatically as clients connect and disconnect.
        handler_nursery (trio.Nursery): Trio nursery for managing background
            tasks and client operations. Set during server startup and used
            for structured concurrency management.

    Connection Management:
        - Clients are registered by remote address when they connect
        - Connection lifecycle is managed automatically with proper cleanup
        - Failed connections are logged and handled gracefully
        - Multiple clients can be active simultaneously with independent state

    Abstract Methods:
        Subclasses must implement:
        - ``add_context``: Handle contextual information from game clients
        - ``choose_force_action``: Implement AI-driven action selection logic

    Note:
        - This is an abstract base class requiring concrete implementation
        - SSL/TLS support is available but optional
        - Server runs until manually stopped or encounters critical errors
        - Designed for integration with external Neuro AI systems

    Example Usage:

    """Console-based interactive implementation of Neuro Server for development and testing.

    This concrete implementation provides a human-operated interface for
    testing Neuro API integration without requiring a full AI system.
    It uses console input/output to simulate Neuro's decision-making
    process, making it ideal for development, debugging, and demonstration.

    Key Features:
        - **Interactive Console Interface**: Human operator makes decisions via console
        - **Development Testing**: Test game clients without full AI infrastructure
        - **Action Visualization**: Clear display of available actions and context
        - **Schema Support**: Handles JSON schema validation and data input
        - **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate console output for context messages

    Use Cases:
        - Development and testing of game client integrations
        - Debugging WebSocket communication protocols
        - Demonstrating Neuro API capabilities to stakeholders
        - Educational purposes for understanding the Neuro system

    Limitations:
        - Requires human operator interaction for all decisions
        - Not suitable for production or automated scenarios
        - Console-based interface may not scale for complex interactions
        - No persistent state or learning capabilities

    Note:
        - This implementation is synchronous from the operator's perspective
        - Trio checkpoints are used to maintain cooperative multitasking
        - All AI decision-making is replaced with human console interaction
        - Suitable only for development and demonstration environments

    Example Usage:
        >>> server = ConsoleInteractiveNeuroServer()
        >>> await server.run("localhost", 8000)
        >>> # Server will prompt operator for all AI decisions via console
