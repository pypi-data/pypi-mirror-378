# 2) Privacy Policy

**Who we are.** StatLine LLC provides analytics software and APIs (SLAPI). Contact: **[privacy@statline.app](mailto:privacy@statline.app)**.

## A. What We Collect

1. **Account & Org Data** – email, handle/username, organization name, billing contact (if paid).
2. **Credentials** – REGKEYs, API tokens, hashed secrets, OAuth identifiers where applicable.
3. **Operational Metadata** – timestamps, IP address, user agent, request/response sizes, latency, HTTP status, endpoint path, rate‑limit counters, error codes.
4. **Limited Request Fragments** – minimal input/output snippets for debugging, abuse detection, and quality (redacted where feasible).
5. **Product Analytics** – page events, feature usage, and diagnostics (aggregated/pseudonymized when possible).
6. **Communications** – emails, support messages, and metadata.
7. **Cookies & Local Storage** – session management, CSRF, analytics preferences.

We **do not** intentionally collect sensitive categories (e.g., health, precise geolocation) and do not sell personal data.

## B. Why We Process Data (Purposes)

* Provide the Service and core functionality (auth, routing, scoring).
* Secure the platform, prevent abuse, and investigate incidents.
* Measure reliability and improve adapters/algorithms.
* Communicate with you about updates, security, and support.
* Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms/AUP.

## C. Legal Bases (GDPR/UK GDPR)

* **Contractual necessity** (provide the Service).
* **Legitimate interests** (security, quality, analytics proportionate to privacy).
* **Consent** (where required for non‑essential cookies/communications).
* **Legal obligation** (regulatory, law‑enforcement requests).

## D. Retention

* Account & org data: for the life of the account and up to **180 days** after closure.
* Logs & operational metadata: typically **90–180 days** (shorter for high‑volume traces).
* Security/abuse records: as long as necessary to protect the Service.
* Backups: follow rolling cycles (target ≤ **35 days**).

## E. Sharing & Subprocessors

We use vetted service providers (cloud hosting, email, analytics, observability, billing). We restrict access to least privilege and bind them by contract. A current subprocessor list is available upon request or posted at **/legal/subprocessors**.

## F. International Transfers

Where data moves outside your region, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs for EEA/UK). You may request a copy of relevant transfer mechanisms.

## G. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to **access, correct, delete, port, or restrict** processing. Submit requests to **[privacy@statline.app](mailto:privacy@statline.app)**. If we process data on behalf of an org, we may redirect your request to that controller.

## H. Children

The Service is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us for removal.

## I. Security

We employ encryption in transit, access controls, network isolation, and monitoring. No method is 100% secure; promptly notify us of suspected issues.

## J. Cookies/Tracking Choices

We use essential cookies for login/session and, where applicable, analytics cookies with consent controls. Browser **Do Not Track** signals are not reliably honored across vendors; use our in‑product controls.

## K. Data Protection Contact & Complaints

Questions or complaints: **[privacy@statline.app](mailto:privacy@statline.app)**. EEA/UK residents may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in their country.

## L. Changes

We may update this Policy. Material changes will be posted with a new Effective Date. Continued use indicates acceptance.
