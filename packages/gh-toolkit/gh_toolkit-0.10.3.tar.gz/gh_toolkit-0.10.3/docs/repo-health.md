# comments starting with # are ignored
octocat/Hello-World
microsoft/vscode
torvalds/linux

# empty lines are ignored

python/cpython
nodejs/node
```

## Integration with Other Commands

### Complete Quality Workflow

```bash

gh-toolkit repo list myorg --output repos.txt

# 2. Check health
gh-toolkit repo health repos.txt --output health.json --min-score 80

# 3. Extract data for compliant repositories
gh-toolkit repo extract repos.txt --output compliant_repos.json

# 4. Generate portfolio site
gh-toolkit site generate compliant_repos.json --theme professional
```

### Automated Monitoring

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily health monitoring script

DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
gh-toolkit repo list myorg --output "repos_$DATE.txt"
gh-toolkit repo health "repos_$DATE.txt" --output "health_$DATE.json" --min-score 75

# Alert if too many repositories fail
FAILED=$(jq '[.[] | select(.percentage < 75)] | length' "health_$DATE.json")
if [ "$FAILED" -gt 5 ]; then
    echo "Warning: $FAILED repositories failed health checks"
fi
```

## Best Practices

### For Repository Owners
1. **Regular Health Checks** - Monitor repository health monthly
2. **Address High-Impact Issues** - Focus on README, tests, and CI/CD first
3. **Use Appropriate Rule Sets** - Match rule set to repository purpose
4. **Track Improvements** - Use JSON output to track progress over time

### For Educators
1. **Set Clear Standards** - Use academic rules with appropriate thresholds
2. **Provide Feedback** - Share health reports with students
3. **Monitor Class Progress** - Track improvements over semester
4. **Template Repositories** - Create templates that pass health checks

### For Organizations
1. **Establish Standards** - Use professional rules with high thresholds
2. **Automate Monitoring** - Integrate health checks into CI/CD
3. **Provide Training** - Help developers understand best practices
4. **Track Metrics** - Monitor organizational repository health trends

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

**Token Permission Issues**
- Ensure GitHub token has `repo` scope for private repositories
- Use `public_repo` scope for public repositories only

**API Rate Limiting**
- Use authenticated requests with GitHub token
- Add delays between checks for large repository lists
- Monitor rate limit headers

**Repository Access Issues**
- Verify repository names are correct (owner/repo format)
- Check that repositories exist and are accessible
- Ensure token has appropriate permissions

### Performance Optimization

**Large Repository Lists**
- Process repositories in batches
- Use `--no-details` for faster processing
- Increase delays between requests if rate limited

**Slow API Responses**
- Check GitHub API status
- Use minimal necessary scopes on tokens
- Consider caching results for repeated checks
