SlowDOS revision history.

07-05-04        version 1.03
                added /t option to command line which allows for the TSR
                to disable itself (timeout) after xx seconds.

                Note that the seconds value is rather arbitrary.
                Running under windows or with large delay values can alter
                the iterations the TSR can be called per second, which will
                throw off the internal second counter.
                Season to taste.  You get what you paid for.
