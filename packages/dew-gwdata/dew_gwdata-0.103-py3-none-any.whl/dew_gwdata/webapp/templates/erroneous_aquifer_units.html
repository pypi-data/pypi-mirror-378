    The units below have been entered incorrectly into SA Geodata. To enter
    them correctly, the part of the code which is uppercase should be entered
    as the Major Unit and the remaining characters should be entered as the
    Sub Unit.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Qpcb should be entered as Major Unit "Q" and Sub Unit "pcb"</p>
<p>CP-j should be entered as Major Unit "CP" and Sub Unit "-j"</p>
<p>Ty(conf) should be entered as Major Unit "T" and Sub Unit "y(conf)"</p>
<p>AD should be entered as Major Unit "AD" and Sub Unit left blank</p>
<p>TpQau should be entered as Major Unit "TpQ" and Sub Unit "au"</p>

<p>and so on.</p>
