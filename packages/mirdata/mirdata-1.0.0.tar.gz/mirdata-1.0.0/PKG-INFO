This library provides tools for working with common MIR datasets, including tools for:
* downloading datasets to a common location and format
* validating that the files for a dataset are all present 
* loading annotation files to a common format, consistent with the format required by [mir_eval](https://github.com/craffel/mir_eval)
* parsing track level metadata for detailed evaluations


### Installation

To install, simply run:

```python
pip install mirdata
```

### Quick example
```python
import mirdata

orchset = mirdata.initialize('orchset')
orchset.download()  # download the dataset
orchset.validate()  # validate that all the expected files are there

example_track = orchset.choice_track()  # choose a random example track
print(example_track)  # see the available data
```
See the [documentation](https://mirdata.readthedocs.io/) for more examples and the API reference.


### Currently supported datasets


Supported datasets include [AcousticBrainz](https://zenodo.org/record/2553414#.X8jTgulKhhE), [DALI](https://github.com/gabolsgabs/DALI), [Guitarset](http://github.com/marl/guitarset/), [MAESTRO](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro), [TinySOL](https://www.orch-idea.org/), among many others.

For the **complete list** of supported datasets, see the [documentation](https://mirdata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/quick_reference.html)


### Citing


There are two ways of citing mirdata:

If you are using the library for your work, please cite the version you used as indexed at Zenodo:
