        Registers the debug service in the application container.

        This method binds the `IDebug` interface to its concrete implementation, the `Debug` class,
        within the application's dependency injection container. The service is registered as
        transient, ensuring that a new instance is created each time it is requested. Additionally,
        an alias is assigned to the service for convenient retrieval throughout the application.

        This registration enables the application to resolve dependencies related to debugging,
        error reporting, and console diagnostics by referencing the interface or its alias.

        Returns

        None
            This method does not return any value. It performs side effects by modifying
            the application's service registry.
