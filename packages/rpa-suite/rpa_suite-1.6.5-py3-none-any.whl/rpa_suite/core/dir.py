class Directory:
    """
    Class that provides utilities for directory management, including creating, deleting, and manipulating directories.

    This class offers functionalities for:
        - Creating temporary directories
        - Deleting directories
        - Checking if a directory exists
        - Listing files in a directory

    Methods:
        create_temp_dir: Creates a temporary directory for file operations.

    The Directory class is part of RPA Suite and can be accessed through the rpa object:
        >>> from rpa_suite import rpa
        >>> rpa.directory.create_temp_dir(path_to_create='my_folder', name_temp_dir='temp_dir')

    Parameters:
        path_to_create (str): The full path where the temporary directory should be created. Default is 'default', which creates it in the current directory.
        name_temp_dir (str): The name of the temporary directory to be created. Default is 'temp'.
