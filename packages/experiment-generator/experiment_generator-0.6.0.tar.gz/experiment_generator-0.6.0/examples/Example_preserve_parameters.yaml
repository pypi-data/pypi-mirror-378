Perturbation_Experiment:
  # This section demonstrates various ways to specify parameters for perturbation experiments.
  # You can mix and match these methods as needed.


  # 1. Simple values
  Parameter_block1:
    branches:
      - perturb_1a
      - perturb_2a
    ice/cice_in.nml:
      setup_nml:
        # both branches share the following updates
        use_leap_years: PRESERVE # keeps the original use_leap_years = .true.
        use_restart_time: False # use_restart_time = .false.
        diagfreq: REMOVE # diagfreq is removed
        runtype: # empty or null or ~ sets -> runtype = None


  # 2. Per-branch lists
  Parameter_block2:
    branches:
      - perturb_1b
      - perturb_2b
      - perturb_3b
    ice/cice_in.nml:
      setup_nml:
        use_restart_time:
          # 1st branch
          - # empty or null or ~ sets -> runtype = None
          # 2nd branch
          - REMOVE # use_restart_time is removed
          # 3rd branch
          - PRESERVE # keeps the original use_restart_time = .true.


  # 3. Lists of lists (positional indexing)

      - perturb_1c
      - perturb_2c
      - perturb_3c

      diag_table:
      # Each entry under `diag_table` is a nested mapping. Some inner keys
      # (e.g. `file_name`) can themselves contain lists. This example shows
      # how to control them with special markers:
      #   - Use PRESERVE to keep specific elements unchanged.
      #   - Use REMOVE to drop specific elements.
      #
      # For list indexing: if you only want to change, say, the 3rd or 4th
      # elements, mark the 1st and 2nd with PRESERVE. Any elements beyond
      # those you explicitly modify are left unchanged.
