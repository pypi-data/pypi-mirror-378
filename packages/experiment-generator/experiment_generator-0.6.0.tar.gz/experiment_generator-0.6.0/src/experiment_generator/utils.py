Utility module

This module provides helper functions
 - `update_config_entries`: Recursively apply updates or removals to nested dictionaries.
 - Support for two special markers:
    - "REMOVE": delete a key or element (or set to ``None`` if ``pop_key=False``).
        #TODO: pop_key=False should be removed?
    - "PRESERVE": keep a key or element (do not delete or modify).
