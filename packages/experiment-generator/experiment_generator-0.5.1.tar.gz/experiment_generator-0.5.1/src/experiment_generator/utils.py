    Recursively update or remove entries in a nested dictionary in place.

    - If both base[k] and change[k] are mappings, merge recursively.

        * REMOVED in mappings -> drop key (pop_key=True) or set None (pop_key=False).
        * REMOVED in sequences -> drop element; elements that clean to {} -> drop element.

       - If k remains, use its cleaned value.
       - If k is absent, it was removed during cleaning, so remove it from base.
