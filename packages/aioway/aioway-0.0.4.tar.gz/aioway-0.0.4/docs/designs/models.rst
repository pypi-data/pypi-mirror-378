Models
######

Compiling
*********

.. todo::

    How do I define a good model to use?
    Do I do cost-based optimization?

Versioning
**********

.. todo::

    Version control strategies, model storage etc.

Parameter tuning
****************

.. todo::

    Some layers, for example convolution layers,
    change their shape's mapping based on the parameters.
    How to support them in a way that doesn't break the rest of the code?

Tracing and resource detection
******************************

Tracing the models automatically would allow us to know how much a model needs at runtime,
and this would also allow for cost-based optimization.

ML Ops
******

.. todo::

    Make deploying very easy.
