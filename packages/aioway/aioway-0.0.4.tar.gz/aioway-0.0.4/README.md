# AioWay

## ü§î Why Aioway

In the recent years, machine learning's entry barrier has gotten higher, rather than lower. With the increasing number of algorithms and libraries and models, it's no wonder qualified data scientists are rare because you would need years of training to keep up to the status quo.

We designed Aioway in a way such that instead of thinking about **how** to do ML, you specify **what** to do. Instead of focusing on what algorithms and models to use, Aioway allows you to focus on the use cases by taking into account the context of the problem, and perform compliation according to the data to ensure good performance. Automatically.

## üç∞ Aioway's features

- Aioway looks just like SQL. No need to learn another langauge.
- Aioway's compiler would automatically detect the task at hand and use the best models and algorithms automatically.
- Aioway allows you to quickly tune the underlying model, or specify constraints so that the runtime uses your computational resources wisely.
- Aioway allows users to easily plug in their own code (PyTorch code) whenver the provided utility is not satisfactory.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

For the pre-release version (`v0.0.*`), see [project](https://github.com/users/rentruewang/projects/7) for more details.
