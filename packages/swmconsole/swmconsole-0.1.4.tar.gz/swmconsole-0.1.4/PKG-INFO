Sky Port terminal implemented as a console script written in Python
=====================================================================

# Description

Sky Port is an universal bus between user software and compute resources.
It can also be considered as a transportation layer between workload producers
and compute resource providers. Sky Port makes it easy to connect user software
to different cloud resources. This is a parto of [Open Workload](http://openworkload.org) project.

The current project represents a console program that uses swmclient python package
to utilize client API of the [Sky Port core daemon](https://github.com/openworkload/swm-core).
The source code of this package can be found [here](https://github.com/openworkload/swm-console-term).
