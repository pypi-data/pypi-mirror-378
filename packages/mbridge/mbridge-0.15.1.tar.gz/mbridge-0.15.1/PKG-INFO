# Important
[Megatron-Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge) is the official NVIDIA maintained version, we will migrate to Megatron-Bridge soon.

# MBridge: Bridge Megatron-Core to Hugging Face/Reinforcement Learning

MBridge provides a seamless bridge between Hugging Face models and Megatron-Core's optimized implementation for efficient distributed training and inference. It also offers necessary tools and processes for integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Megatron.

MBridge is a prototype project, the idea has been adopted as [Megatron-Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge). For more advanced features such as training loop, mixed precision(FP8, BF16, FP4 etc.), PEFT, please refer to Megatron-Bridge.

## 202508 Update
- Support loading FP8 HF weights directly when training DeepSeekV3 models with bfloat16, without saving extra Megatron-Core format weights (MTP included, based on the dequantization kernel provided by DeepSeek) see example/4

## Overview

MBridge allows you to convert popular Hugging Face models to Megatron-Core format, enabling you to leverage advanced parallelism strategies for large-scale training and inference. The library supports various model architectures and simplifies the process of transitioning between these frameworks. For Reinforcement Learning workflows, MBridge provides interfaces and tools needed to connect RL algorithms with Megatron-optimized models.

## Feature Highlights

- **Comprehensive Model Support**: Support for various model architectures including MoE models (Mixture of Experts)
- **Online Weight Import**: Online loading HF weights with various parallelism strategies, auto shard the weights, no need to save extra Megatron-Core format weights
- **Online Weight Export**: Online exporting weights to HF format for inference engines, with support for TP/PP/CP/VPP/EP/ETP parallelism strategies
- **Memory Friendly**: Use per-tensor strategies, minimize the memory peak when loading/exporting HF format weights.
- **Simple API**: Intuitive interfaces for model conversion and weight management
- **Support Transformer Engine**: Use the powerful Transformer Engine to accelerate Megatron-Core models for better performance (use_te=False is not supported now)

## Installation

```bash
pip install mbridge
```

## Quick Start

```python
from megatron.core import parallel_state as mpu
from mbridge import AutoBridge

# Initialize distributed environment
mpu.initialize_model_parallel(
    tensor_model_parallel_size=tp,
    pipeline_model_parallel_size=pp,
    virtual_pipeline_model_parallel_size=vpp,
    context_parallel_size=cp,
    expert_model_parallel_size=ep,
)

# Load a model from Hugging Face
HF_MODEL_PATH = "/path/to/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"
# or llama model
HF_MODEL_PATH = "/path/to/llama/llama3-8b-instruct"
bridge = AutoBridge.from_pretrained(HF_MODEL_PATH)

# Get a Megatron-Core model and load weights from Hugging Face
model = bridge.get_model(weight_path=HF_MODEL_PATH)

# Export weights back to Hugging Face format for inference engine
for key, weight in bridge.export_weights(model):
    # Process or save the exported weights
    print(f"Exported: {key}")

# save model with HF format
bridge.save_weights(model, "path/to/save/model", memory_efficient=False) # set memory_efficient=True if the model is vary large
```

## Supported Models

Currently supported models:
- [x] Qwen2
- [x] Qwen2-MoE
- [x] Qwen3
- [x] Qwen3-MoE
- [x] LLaMA
- [x] DeepseekV3
- [x] Mixtral
- [x] Qwen2.5-VL
- [x] Mimo


## Examples

The `example` directory contains scripts demonstrating common use cases:

- `0.load_model_and_generate_single_gpu.py`: Loading a model and generating text on a single GPU
- `1.load_model_and_export_single_gpu.py`: Loading a model and exporting weights on a single GPU
- `2.load_model_and_export_multiple_gpus.py`: Loading a model and exporting weights using multiple GPUs with TP/PP/CP/VPP parallelism

### Post Model Creation Callbacks

MBridge provides a set of post model creation callbacks to customize the model after it is created.

- `make_value_model`: Add a value model to the model
- `freeze_moe_router`: Freeze the router of the model

```python
from mbridge.utils.post_creation_callbacks import make_value_model, freeze_moe_router

bridge = AutoBridge.from_pretrained(HF_MODEL_PATH)
model = bridge.get_model(weight_path=HF_MODEL_PATH, post_model_creation_callbacks=[make_value_model, freeze_moe_router])

```

## Development Roadmap

MBridge will continue to maintain support for popular models, but will not develop more advanced features.
See [Megatron-Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge) for more advanced features.
