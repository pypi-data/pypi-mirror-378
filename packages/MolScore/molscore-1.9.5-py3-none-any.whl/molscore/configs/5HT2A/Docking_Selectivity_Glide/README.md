# Running these tasks

Note that in order to run these tasks you must replace the file paths both in the `.json` file and in the Glide input file `.in`.

For example in the config you must specify the full correct path here replacing this line,
```JSON
"glide_template": "/6A93_3x32_ChEMBL31-5HT2A-selective_ligs.in"
```

Likewise in the Glide input file you must specify the full correct path replacing this line,
```
GRIDFILE   ./6A93_D3x32_grid.zip
```
