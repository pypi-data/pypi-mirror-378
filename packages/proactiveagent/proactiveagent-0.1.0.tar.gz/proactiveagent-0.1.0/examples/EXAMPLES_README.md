## Key Features Demonstrated

### Sleep Time Calculators
1. **AIBasedSleepCalculator** - Uses AI provider to determine optimal wake-up timing
2. **StaticSleepCalculator** - Fixed intervals for predictable behavior
3. **FunctionBasedSleepCalculator** - Custom functions for adaptive timing
4. **PatternBasedSleepCalculator** - Keyword pattern matching for timing decisions

### Decision Engines
1. **AIBasedDecisionEngine** - Intelligent context-aware decision making
2. **SimpleDecisionEngine** - Basic time-based response decisions
3. **ThresholdDecisionEngine** - Priority-based response thresholds
4. **FunctionBasedDecisionEngine** - Custom decision logic functions

### Configuration Parameters

All examples show how to configure:
- `min_response_interval` - Minimum time between responses
- `max_response_interval` - Maximum time before forced response
- `engagement_threshold` - Overall engagement threshold (0.0-1.0)
- `engagement_high_threshold` - Message count for "high" engagement
- `engagement_medium_threshold` - Message count for "medium" engagement  
- `context_relevance_weight` - Weight for context in decisions
- `time_weight` - Weight for time-based factors
- `probability_weight` - Weight for probabilistic factors
- `wake_up_pattern` - Pattern description for sleep calculations
- `min_sleep_time` - Minimum sleep duration in seconds
- `max_sleep_time` - Maximum sleep duration in seconds

### Callback Types

Three types of callbacks are demonstrated:

1. **Response Callbacks** - Called when AI generates a response
   ```python
   def on_ai_response(response: str):
       print(f"AI: {response}")
   agent.add_callback(on_ai_response)
   ```

2. **Sleep Time Callbacks** - Called when sleep time is calculated
   ```python
   def on_sleep_time_calculated(sleep_time: int, reasoning: str):
       print(f"Sleep: {sleep_time}s - {reasoning}")
   agent.add_sleep_time_callback(on_sleep_time_calculated)
   ```

3. **Decision Callbacks** - Called when response decision is made
   ```python
   def on_decision_made(should_respond: bool, reasoning: str):
       decision = "RESPOND" if should_respond else "WAIT"
       print(f"Decision: {decision} - {reasoning}")
   agent.add_decision_callback(on_decision_made)
   ```

## Running Examples

Each example is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
# Basic configuration example
python all_config_parameters.py

# Sleep calculator examples
python ai_based_sleep_calculator.py
python static_sleep_calculator.py
python function_based_sleep_calculator.py
python pattern_based_sleep_calculator.py

# Decision engine examples  
python ai_based_decision_engine.py
python simple_decision_engine.py
python threshold_decision_engine.py
python function_based_decision_engine.py

# Custom implementation examples
python custom_sleep_calculator.py
python custom_decision_engine.py

# Callback examples
python comprehensive_callbacks.py
```

## Learning Path

Recommended order for learning the library:

1. **Start with** `all_config_parameters.py` to understand basic configuration
2. **Try sleep calculators** in order: AI-based ‚Üí Static ‚Üí Function-based ‚Üí Pattern-based
3. **Try decision engines** in order: AI-based ‚Üí Simple ‚Üí Threshold ‚Üí Function-based
4. **Explore callbacks** with `comprehensive_callbacks.py`
5. **Build custom implementations** using the custom examples as templates

## Tips for Development

- **API Key**: Replace `"your-openai-api-key-here"` with your actual OpenAI API key
- **Logging**: Set `log_level="DEBUG"` in agent configuration to see detailed operation logs
- **Experimentation**: Modify configuration values to see how they affect behavior
- **Custom Logic**: Use the custom implementation examples as starting points for your own logic
- **Monitoring**: Use callbacks to monitor and analyze agent behavior in real-time

## Example Output

When running examples, you'll see output like:

```
ü§ñ AI: Hello! How can I help you today?
‚è∞ Sleep time: 120s - Medium engagement detected, checking every 2 minutes
üß† Decision: ‚úÖ RESPOND - User asked a question - immediate response
üìù Logged response #1
üìä Response Analysis: 8 words, positive sentiment
```

This shows the integration of AI responses, sleep calculations, decision making, and callback monitoring.
