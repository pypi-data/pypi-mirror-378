class RequestDownload:
    """
    Handles Request Download (0x34) service requests.

    What:
        This service is used to initiate a data download from the client to
        the server (ECU). It's the first step in the process of flashing new
        software or writing a large block of data to the ECU.

    Why:
        It prepares the ECU to receive data, and the ECU can specify the
        maximum size of the data blocks it can accept at a time.

    How:
        The client sends a request with the SID 0x34, the memory address
        where the data should be stored, and the total size of the data.

    Note:
        This service is not fully implemented in this simulator.

class RequestUpload:

    Handles Request Upload (0x35) service requests.

    What:
        This service is used to initiate a data upload from the server (ECU)
        to the client.

    Why:
        It's used to read large blocks of data from the ECU, such as log
        files, calibration data, or the entire memory content.

    How:
        The client sends a request with the SID 0x35, the memory address
        of the data to be uploaded, and the size of the data.

class TransferData:
    """
    Handles Transfer Data (0x36) service requests.

    What:
        This service is used to transfer data blocks between the client and
        the server during an upload or download operation.

    Why:
        It's the workhorse of the data transfer process, responsible for
        moving the actual data in chunks.

    How:
        After a download or upload is initiated, the client (for downloads)
        or server (for uploads) sends a sequence of Transfer Data requests,
        each containing a block of data.

class RequestTransferExit:
    """
    Handles Request Transfer Exit (0x37) service requests.

    What:
        This service is used to terminate a data transfer sequence.

    Why:
        It signals the end of the upload or download process, allowing the
        server to perform any necessary cleanup or verification.

    How:
        The client sends a request with the SID 0x37 to indicate that the
        transfer is complete.

    Handles Request File Transfer (0x38) service requests.

    What:
        This service provides a more advanced and flexible way to transfer
        files between the client and the server, often with file-system-like
        operations.

    Why:
        It's designed to be more powerful than the older upload/download
        services, supporting more complex use cases.

    How:
        The specifics are complex and can vary between implementations.
