Pyeo is an advanced static analysis tool tailored specifically to enforce the
principles advocated by Elegant Objects ([elegantobjects.org](https://elegantobjects.org)) in Python projects.
It serves as a quality control instrument to ensure
that your Python code adheres to the core tenets of elegance, simplicity,
and maintainability.

The project is inspired by the team that made fun of me because of the lego build. STT lambda ❤️️

```bash
pip install eo-styleguide
```

Simple example of usage:

```python
from typing import Protocol, final

import attrs


class House(Protocol):
    def area(self) -> int: ...


@final
@attrs.define(frozen=True)
class HttpHouse(House):

    def area(self) -> int:
        return 10
```

```bash
mypy file.py && flake8 file.py
```

## No null

Mypy helps prevent `AttributeError` and other type-related errors by providing
static type checking for Python code. It allows specifying variable types,
function arguments, and return types to catch potential type issues before the
program runs. By using Mypy, developers can identify and fix problems related
to attribute access and other type mismatches, leading to improved code
quality and easier maintenance.

Example:

```python
class Employee(object):
    def __init__(self, user_id: int):
        self._user_id = user_id

def get_by_id(user_id: int) -> Employee:
    if user_id < 0:
        return None
    return Employee(user_id)
```

Mypy return next violation:

```
error: Incompatible return value type (got "None", expected "Employee")  [return-value]
```

So, we must use `typing.Optional` or `|` (union) operator.

It's works:

```
def get_by_id(user_id: int) -> Optional[Employee]: ...
def get_by_id(user_id: int) -> Employee | None: ...
```

## No code in constructors

You can use `@attrs.define` for skip this. It decorator create ctor for your
classes automatically. However, we implement check that your primary and
secondary ctors not contain code, with the exception of attributes assingment.
Please check [CodeFreeCtorVisitor](pyeo/features/code_free_ctor_visitor.py).

## No getters and setters

Actually we realize functional for to prohibit the use of `@property` and
`@setter` method decorators. You can use `@attrs.define(frozen=True)` in order
to make an object immutable.

Prohibit the use of `@property` decorator not protect from evil of getters,
so if you can ideas how we can implement more complex check,
create issue please.

## No mutable objects

`attrs.define(frozen=True)` is a parameter used in the attrs library to create
classes with attributes that cannot be modified after the instance is created
(i.e., immutable or "frozen" classes).

The [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/) library allows defining classes
using the `@attr.s` decorator or by explicitly calling the `attr.define`
function, and `frozen=True` is one of the parameters for specifying attribute
behavior in the class. 

When you use `attrs.define(frozen=True)` for a class, all its attributes become
read-only after the instance is created, making the class "frozen" or
"immutable," preventing any changes to its attribute values.

See [NoMutableObjectsVisitor](pyeo/features/no_mutable_objects.py)

## No er suffix

We check you class name not contain `-er` or `(C|c)lient` suffix by check in
[NoErNamesFeature](/pyeo/features/no_er_names.py)

## No static methods

TODO

## No reflection

TODO

Prohibit next function calls:
- `isinstance`
- `type`
- `issubclass`
- `hasattr`

## No public methods without a contract

In Python, `typing.Protocol` is a class introduced in Python 3.8 as part of the
typing module. It is used to define structural subtyping or "duck typing" for
classes, which allows you to create interfaces without using explicit inheritance.

[flake8-override](https://github.com/blablatdinov/flake8-override) plugin check that all
of public class methods has protocol.

## No statements in tests

TODO

## No ORM

Detect using ORM or ActiveRecord tools on project by design/code review

## No inheritance

Each class must be `typing.final`.
Check by [flake8-final](https://github.com/blablatdinov/flake8-final)
