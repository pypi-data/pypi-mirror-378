# GNOMAN LICENSE AGREEMENT

This License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between the Licensor and the undersigned Licensee. By executing this Agreement, Licensee acknowledges and accepts the following binding terms and conditions:

---

### 1. Form of Execution

This Agreement is valid **only** when signed in handwritten ink by both Licensor and Licensee **on physical paper in the presence of a notary public**.

Electronic signatures, scanned copies, PDF acknowledgments, facsimiles, or any other digital substitutes are expressly rejected as invalid. No license is created by purchase receipt, digital acknowledgment, or possession of GNOMAN software unless and until a signed physical copy of this Agreement has been executed.

---

### 2. Definitions

* **“GNOMAN System”** means the proprietary toolkit, methods, persistence hierarchies, custodial safeguards, and cryptographic processes developed by Licensor.
* **“Outputs”** means any scripts, signed transactions, audit logs, or results generated by the GNOMAN System.

---

### 3. Grant of License

Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use GNOMAN **only if Licensee holds an original paper copy of this Agreement bearing Licensor’s handwritten signature.**

No person, entity, or organization may use, copy, execute, or distribute GNOMAN without possession of such signed Agreement.

---

### 4. Proprietary Rights and Restrictions

* Title and ownership of GNOMAN remain vested exclusively in Licensor at all times.
* Licensee may not:
  (i) copy, distribute, modify, or reverse engineer GNOMAN;
  (ii) sublicense, rent, lease, or resell GNOMAN;
  (iii) remove or alter any branding, signatures, or forensic markers embedded by Licensor.
* Any derivative works or improvements created by Licensee automatically belong to Licensor.

---

### 5. Conditions of Use

Licenses are granted **individually**. Each Licensee must hold their own signed paper agreement. Possession of GNOMAN without such an agreement constitutes willful infringement and theft.

---

### 6. Revocability

Licensor may revoke this license upon breach of any term. Upon revocation, Licensee must immediately cease all use and destroy all copies of GNOMAN.

---

### 7. Audit and Verification

Licensor retains the right to demand production of the original signed license at any time. Failure to produce it upon request is prima facie evidence of infringement.

---

### 8. Governing Law and Venue

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of **Iowa**, with venue exclusively in Woodbury County, Iowa, or the Northern District of Iowa.

---

### 9. Entire Agreement

This Agreement represents the full and exclusive license terms. No oral promises, digital acknowledgments, or electronic agreements have any effect.

---

### 10. Forfeiture

Any unauthorized use of GNOMAN voids all rights and forfeits any benefits, results, or profits obtained from such use.

---

This Agreement embodies GNOMAN’s spirit: **ancient, deliberate, notarized, and absolute. Only a signed sheet of paper with real ink creates rights. Without it, you have nothing.**
