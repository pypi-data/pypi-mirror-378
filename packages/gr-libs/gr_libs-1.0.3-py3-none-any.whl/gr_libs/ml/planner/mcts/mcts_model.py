class MonteCarloTreeSearch:
    """
    Monte Carlo Tree Search class for performing search on an environment using a tree data structure.

    Explanation on hashing and uncertainty in the acto outcome:
    We want to detect circles, while not preventing expected behavior.
    To achieve it, hasing must include previous state, action, and resulting state.
    Hashing the direction means coming to the same position from different positions gets different id's.
    Example: the agent might have stood at (2,2), picked action 2 (forward), and accidently turned right,
    resulting at state ((2,2), right).
    later, when the agent stood at (2,1), looked right and walked forward,
    it got to the same state. We would want to enable that, because
    this is the expected behavior, so these nodes must have unique id's.
    The situations where circles will indeed be detected, are only if the outcome was the same for the previous state,
    consistent with the action - whether it was or wasn't expected.

    Args:
        env (gym.Env): The environment to perform the search on.
        tree (Tree): The tree data structure to store the search tree.
        goal (object): The goal state of the search.
        use_heuristic (bool, optional): Whether to use a heuristic function during the search. Defaults to True.
