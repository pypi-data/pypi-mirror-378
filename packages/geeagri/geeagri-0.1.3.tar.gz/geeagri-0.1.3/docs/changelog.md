**New Features**:

- `MovingWindowSmoothing` class for applying moving window smoothing to time series data.
  - Helps in reducing noise and filling short cloud-induced gaps.
- `TemporalInterpolation` class for interpolating gaps in satellite time series.
- `RegularTimeseries` class for converting irregular satellite time series into regular intervals.
  - Flexible frequency specification (e.g., 5-day, 10-day, 15-day).

**Improvements**:

- Expanded documentation with notebook examples for smoothing, interpolation, and regularization workflows.

## v0.1.2 – 2025-09-01

**New Features**:

- `TimeseriesExtractor` class for downloading per-feature CSV time series from Earth Engine `ee.ImageCollection`.
  - Point geometries: uses `getRegion`, no reducer required.
  - Polygon/MultiPolygon geometries: supports reducers for aggregation.
  - Exports directly to CSV for downstream analysis.
- `HarmonicRegression` class for performing harmonic regression on Earth Engine `ee.ImageCollection`.
  - Computes harmonic coefficients with configurable order and base frequency.
  - Provides phase and amplitude outputs for phenology and seasonal dynamics analysis.
  - Supports fitted harmonic time series generation for visualization or modeling.

**Improvements**:

- Updated docstrings for clarity and alignment with function behavior.
- Documentation expanded to include harmonic regression and time series extraction workflows.

## v0.1.1 – 2025-08-06

**New Features**:

- `ImagePatchExtractor` class added for efficient extraction of image patches from Earth Engine `ee.Image` objects using local sample points as `GeoDataFrame`.
- Supports multiple export formats: `png`, `jpg`, `GEO_TIFF`, and others.
- Fully parallelized with configurable number of processes.
- Uses a specified identifier column for naming output files.
- Automatically handles patch sizing via `dimensions` and `buffer` parameters.

**Improvements**
- Improved documentation and example notebooks:
