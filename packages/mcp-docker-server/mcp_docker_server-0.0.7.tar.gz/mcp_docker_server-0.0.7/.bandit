# Exclude test directories since assert statements are normal in tests

# Skip specific checks that are not relevant for this project
skips = B101  # Skip assert_used check since it's normal in tests

# Test IDs to skip:
# B101: assert_used - normal in test files
# Tests should be excluded via exclude_dirs above but this is a backup
