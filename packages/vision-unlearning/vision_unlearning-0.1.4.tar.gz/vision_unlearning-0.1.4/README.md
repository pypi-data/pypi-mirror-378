## Installation

```sh
pip install vision-unlearning
```

## What is Vision Unlearning?

Vision Unlearning provides a standard interface for unlearning algorithms, datasets, metrics, and evaluation methodologies commonly used in Machine Unlearning for vision-related tasks, such as image classification and image generation.

It bridges the gap between research/theory and engineering/practice, making it easier to apply machine unlearning techniques effectively.

Vision Unlearning is designed to be:
- Easy to use
- Easy to extend
- Architecture-agnostic
- Application-agnostic

## Who is it for?

### Researchers
For Machine Unlearning researchers, Vision Unlearning helps with:
- Using the same data splits as other works, including the correct segmentation of forget-retain data and generating data with the same prompts.
- Choosing the appropriate metrics for each task.
- Configuring evaluation setups in a standardized manner.

### Practitioners
For practitioners, Vision Unlearning provides:
- Easy access to state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms.
- A standardized interface to experiment with different algorithms.

## Main Interfaces

Vision Unlearning standardizes the following components:

- **Metric**: Evaluates a model (e.g., FID, CLIP Score, MIA, NudeNet, etc.).
- **Unlearner**: Encapsulates the unlearning algorithm.
- **Dataset**: Encapsulates the dataset, including data splitting.

Additionally, common tasks and evaluation setups are provided as example notebooks. Several platform integrations, such as Hugging Face and Weights & Biases, are also included.
