# AbstractForge

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PLACEHOLDER PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è

**This is a placeholder project to secure the "AbstractForge" name on PyPI.**

AbstractForge will be a future extension of capabilities for [AbstractLLM](https://github.com/abstractllm/abstractllm), but it is currently in the planning phase.

### What is AbstractForge?

AbstractForge is planned to be an advanced toolkit that extends AbstractLLM's capabilities with:
- Enhanced reasoning and logic processing
- Advanced pattern recognition and abstraction
- Extended integration capabilities
- Robust general-purpose algorithms for complex problems

### Current Status

üöß **DEVELOPMENT NOT STARTED** üöß

This package currently contains only placeholder code to reserve the name on PyPI. The actual implementation will be developed in the future.

### Installation

While you can install this placeholder package, it contains no functional code:

```bash
pip install AbstractForge
```

### Usage

Currently, this package only provides a placeholder module:

```python
import abstractforge
print(abstractforge.__version__)  # 0.0.1
print(abstractforge.get_status())  # "This is a placeholder project"
```

### Future Development

The actual AbstractForge project will be developed with:
- Robust general-purpose logic solutions
- Modular and reusable components
- Comprehensive testing
- Clear separation between interface and implementation
- Focus on intellectual honesty and thorough reasoning
