  - **Single Select Choices**\
    List of yaml string marked with `(o)` resembling resembling radio button.

    ```yaml
    answer:
      - ( ) Option 1
      - (o) Option 2 /# feedback for option 2
      - ( ) Option 3
      - ( ) Option 4
    ```

  - **Multiple Select Choices**\
    List of yaml string marked with `(x)` resembling to-do list or checkboxes.

    ```yaml
    answer:
      - ( ) Option 1
      - (x) Option 2 /# feedback for option 2
      - ( ) Option 3 /# feedback for option 3
      - (x) Option 4
    ```
