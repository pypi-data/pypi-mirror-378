# ====== Code Summary ======
# This module defines `SafeRotatingFileHandler`, a safer subclass of
# `RotatingFileHandler` designed to handle file rollover reliably on Windows.
# It uses `os.replace` for atomic moves, and falls back to copy+truncate if the
# file is locked by antivirus or indexers, avoiding stalls or crashes.

# ====== Standard Library Imports ======

    """
    RotatingFileHandler with Windows-friendly rotation strategy.

    Strategy:
        1. Close stream (handled by base in doRollover).
        2. Try fast path: `os.replace(source, dest)` for atomic replacement.
        3. On PermissionError: copy source -> dest, then truncate source to zero.
           (No sleeps, avoids long stalls with antivirus/indexer.)
