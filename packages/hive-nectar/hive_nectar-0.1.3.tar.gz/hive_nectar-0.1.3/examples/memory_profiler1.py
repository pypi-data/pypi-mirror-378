def profiling(name_list):
    """
    Profile memory while retrieving account histories and recent blockchain blocks.

    Creates a Hive instance and registers it as the shared blockchain instance, then iterates over each account name in name_list to:
    - print the account name,
    - instantiate an Account and print its virtual operation count,
    - scan the account history in reverse up to 2018-04-22 00:00:00 and print the last history element found.

    After processing accounts, it constructs a Blockchain instance, determines the current block number, streams the last 20 blocks (current_num-20..current_num), prints each block number as it is streamed, and prints the last block element seen.

    Parameters:
        name_list (iterable[str]): Iterable of account name strings to process.

    Side effects:
        - Registers a shared blockchain instance via set_shared_blockchain_instance(hv).
        - Prints progress and results to standard output.

    Returns:
        None
