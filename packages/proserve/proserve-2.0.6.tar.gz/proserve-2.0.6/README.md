**Build production-ready microservices with minimal code - Python decorators or YAML manifests!**

üéØ **98% Less Boilerplate ‚Ä¢ 5-Minute Start ‚Ä¢ Production Ready**

ProServe is a revolutionary microservices framework that combines the simplicity of Flask with the power of modern architecture. Create APIs, static sites, real-time chat, and more with just a few lines of code.

> üöÄ **Fully Modular Architecture**: All components are now modular, testable, and follow SOLID principles  
> üß™ **Comprehensive E2E Testing**: 8+ test suites covering real-world scenarios, security, performance, and integrations

## ‚ö° Quick Start (3 Lines of Code!)

```python
# app.py
from proserve import Service

app = Service("my-api")

@app.endpoint("/", method="GET")
async def hello(request):
    return {"message": "Hello World! üöÄ"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=8080)
```

```bash
python app.py
# Open: http://localhost:8080
```

**That's it!** You have a production-ready API running.

## üèóÔ∏è Manifest-Driven Development

**Note:** Manifests are **not** outdated. They are a core feature of ProServe, providing a declarative way to define microservices using YAML. The newer decorator-based approach complements manifests, offering flexibility for developers who prefer coding over configuration. Both approaches are fully supported and production-ready.

With tools like [SELLM](https://github.com/tom-sapletta-com/sellm), you can even generate manifests using AI from simple text descriptions, making it incredibly easy to create complex services without manual configuration.

### Example 1: Basic Manifest

```yaml
# manifest.yml
name: my-service
port: 8080

endpoints:
  - path: /api/status
    method: GET
    response:
      status: "ok"
      version: "1.0.0"
  
  - path: /api/hello/{name}
    method: GET
    response:
      message: "Hello {{name}}!"

static:
  enabled: true
  path: ./public
```

```bash
proserve run
# Automatically creates API from manifest.yml
# Open: http://localhost:8080/api/status
# Try: http://localhost:8080/api/hello/World
```

### Example 2: Advanced Manifest with WebSocket

```yaml
# advanced_manifest.yml
name: chat-service
port: 8081

endpoints:
  - path: /api/chat/info
    method: GET
    response:
      status: "Chat Service Running"
      users: 0

websockets:
  - path: /ws/chat
    handler: chat_handler
    on_connect:
      message: "User connected"
    on_disconnect:
      message: "User disconnected"

static:
  enabled: true
  path: ./chat_ui
```

```bash
proserve run advanced_manifest.yml
# Starts a chat service with WebSocket support
# Open: http://localhost:8081/api/chat/info
# Connect WebSocket: ws://localhost:8081/ws/chat
```
