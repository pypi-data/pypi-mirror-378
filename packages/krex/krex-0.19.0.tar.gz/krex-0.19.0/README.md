## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install krex
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Synchronous Usage

```python
import krex
import os

# Initialize client for any supported exchange
client = krex.binance(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    api_secret="your_api_secret"
)

# Get account balance
balance = client.get_account_balance()
print(balance)

# Get market data
klines = client.get_klines(symbol="BTCUSDT", interval="1h")
print(klines)
```

### Asynchronous Usage

```python
import asyncio
import krex.async_support as krex
import os

async def main():
    # Initialize async client
    client = await krex.binance(
        api_key="your_api_key",
        api_secret="your_api_secret"
    )

    try:
        # Get account balance
        balance = await client.get_account_balance()
        print(balance)

        # Get market data
        klines = await client.get_klines(symbol="BTCUSDT", interval="1h")
        print(klines)

    finally:
        await client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## üîç Key Features

- üìò Product Table Manager for unifying trading instruments in different exchanges
- üîÅ Sync & Async API clients with identical interfaces
- ‚ö° Optimized for low-latency, high-frequency trading

## What is Product Table Manager(ptm)?

Ptm is a utility that standardizes and unifies trading instrument metadata across different exchanges, making cross-exchange strategy development easier.

It is a table that contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| exchange | The exchange name |
| product_symbol | The symbol we use to identify the product, it will be the same in different exchanges. For example, `BTC-USDT-SWAP` is the same product in Binance and Bybit, which named `BTCUSDT` in Binance and `BTC-USDT-SWAP` in OKX. |
| exchange_symbol | The symbol that the exchange will actually used |
| product_type | The type we will use, e.g. `spot`, `inverse`, `swap`, `futures` |
| exchange_type | The type the exchange will actually used, e.g. `linear`, `INVERSE`, `perp`... different exchanges have different types, pretty annoying...|
| base_symbol | The base symbol, e.g. `BTC` |
| quote_symbol | The quote symbol, e.g. `USDT` |
| price_precision | The price precision, e.g. `0.000001` |
| size_precision | The size precision, e.g. `0.000001` |
| min_size | The minimum size, e.g. `0.000001` |
| min_notional | The minimum notional, e.g. `0.000001` |
| multiplier | The multiplier of the product, such symbol like `1000BONKUSDT` in Bybit will need to be multiplied by 1000 to get the actual size, if you are trading across spot and swap, you will need this|
| size_per_contract | The size per contract. Sometimes 1 contract is not the same as 1 unit in exchanges like OKX. |

## How to use Product Table Manager?
In most cases, we have handled the case, but if you have any specific use cases, you can use the `ptm` to get the information you want.

```python

import krex

binance = krex.binance()

btcusdt_product_symbol = binance.ptm.get_product_symbol(
    exchange="binance",
    exchange_symbol="BTCUSDT",
    product_type="swap",
)

print(btcusdt_product_symbol)
```
