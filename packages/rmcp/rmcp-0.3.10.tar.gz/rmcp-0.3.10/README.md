## 🎯 Real-World Usage

RMCP works through natural conversation with AI assistants. Here's how users actually interact with it:

### Business Analysis
**You ask Claude:**
> *"I have sales data and marketing spend. Can you analyze the ROI and tell me how effective our marketing is?"*

**Claude responds:**
> *"Based on the regression analysis, every $1 spent on marketing generates $4.70 in additional sales. The relationship is highly significant (p < 0.001) and explains 97.9% of sales variation."*

### Economic Research  
**You ask Claude:**
> *"I have GDP growth and unemployment data for several countries. Can you test if this supports Okun's Law?"*

**Claude responds:**
> *"The correlation analysis shows strong support for Okun's Law with r = -0.944. Higher GDP growth is strongly associated with lower unemployment across your dataset."*

### Data Science
**You ask Claude:**
> *"Help me build a customer churn prediction model using tenure and monthly charges."*

**Claude responds:**
> *"I've built a logistic regression model that achieves 100% accuracy. Longer tenure significantly reduces churn risk (11.3% less likely per month), while higher charges increase churn risk (3% more likely per dollar)."*

### Natural Language Formula Building
**You ask Claude:**
> *"I want to predict sales from marketing spend and customer satisfaction scores. Can you help me build the right formula?"*

**Claude responds:**
> *"I'll help you build that formula. Using the natural language formula builder, I converted your description to: `sales ~ marketing_spend + customer_satisfaction`. This creates a multiple regression model with sales as the outcome and both marketing spend and satisfaction as predictors. I can also suggest alternatives like interaction terms if needed."*

### Intelligent Error Recovery
**You ask Claude:**
> *"I'm getting an error about missing R packages when I try to run my analysis."*

**Claude responds:**
> *"I can help diagnose that error. The issue is that the 'forecast' package is missing, which is required for Time Series Forecasting. You can fix this by running: `install.packages(\"forecast\")`. I can also check all your R packages and install everything RMCP needs at once."*

### 📈 Visual Analytics - See Plots Directly in Claude

**New in v0.3.7**: All visualization tools now display plots **directly in your Claude conversation** - no more file management!

**You ask Claude:**
> *"Create a correlation heatmap of my sales, marketing, and customer satisfaction data"*

**Claude responds with:**
- 📊 **Interactive heatmap displayed inline** showing correlation strengths with color coding
- 📋 **Statistical analysis**: correlation matrix with exact values and significance tests
- 💡 **Insights**: "Strong positive correlation (r=0.89) between marketing and sales suggests effective targeting"

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Quick Start with Claude Desktop

Once RMCP is configured in Claude Desktop, you can immediately start asking for statistical analysis:

**Business Analysis Example:**
```
You: "I have sales data: month 1-12, sales [120, 135, 148, 165, 178, 185, 192, 210, 225, 240, 255, 270]. 
Can you analyze the trend and predict next 3 months?"

Claude: "I'll analyze your sales trend using linear regression and forecasting."
[Claude automatically calls linear_model and then arima_model]

Claude: "Analysis shows strong growth trend with 12.5 units/month increase (R²=0.99). 
Predicted sales for next 3 months: 285, 298, 311 units with 95% confidence intervals."
```

**Scientific Research Example:**
```
You: "I want to test if a new drug is effective. Control group: [2.1, 2.3, 2.0, 2.4, 2.2]. 
Treatment group: [3.1, 3.4, 3.0, 3.3, 3.2]. Please run appropriate statistical test."

Claude: "I'll perform a two-sample t-test to compare the groups."
[Claude calls t_test tool]

Claude: "Results: Treatment group mean (3.2) significantly higher than control (2.2), 
p-value = 0.0001, 95% CI: [0.8, 1.2]. Strong evidence of treatment effect."
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Start MCP server (stdio transport for Claude Desktop)
rmcp start

# Start HTTP server (for web applications and custom clients)
rmcp serve-http --port 8080

# Check version and available tools
rmcp --version

# Development server with debug logging
rmcp start --log-level DEBUG
```

### Direct Tool Usage (Advanced)

For developers building MCP clients or testing tools directly:

```python
import asyncio
from rmcp.core.server import create_server
from rmcp.tools.regression import linear_model

# Create server and context
server = create_server()
context = server.create_context("test-1", "tools/call")

# Call tool directly
result = await linear_model(context, {
    "data": {
        "sales": [100, 120, 140, 160, 180],
        "advertising": [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
    },
    "formula": "sales ~ advertising"
})

print(f"Advertising effectiveness: ${result['coefficients']['advertising']:.2f} per dollar")
print(f"Model explains {result['r_squared']:.1%} of variance")
```

### HTTP Transport Usage

RMCP now supports HTTP transport for web applications and custom integrations:

#### Starting the HTTP Server

```bash
# Install with HTTP support
pip install rmcp[http]

                }
            }
        }]
    }
}
## 🔬 Advanced Usage Scenarios

### Time Series Forecasting

**Business Scenario: Sales Forecasting**
```
You: "I have monthly sales data for 2 years: [150, 162, 178, 195, 210, 225, 240, 255, 270, 285, 300, 315, 
330, 345, 360, 375, 390, 405, 420, 435, 450, 465, 480, 495]. Can you forecast next 6 months?"

Claude: "I'll analyze the time series and create forecasts using ARIMA modeling."
[Claude calls decompose_timeseries and arima_model]

Claude: "Strong upward trend detected. ARIMA(1,1,1) model selected. 
Forecasted sales: 510, 525, 540, 555, 570, 585 with confidence intervals."
```

### Panel Data Analysis  

**Economic Research: Income and Education**
```
You: "I have panel data on income and education across countries and years. 
Can you analyze if education affects income while controlling for country differences?"

Claude: "I'll run a panel regression with fixed effects to control for country characteristics."
[Claude calls panel_regression]

Claude: "Results show each additional year of education increases income by $2,450 (p<0.001), 
controlling for unobserved country characteristics. R²=0.87 within countries."
```

### Machine Learning Workflow

**Customer Segmentation Analysis**
```
You: "Help me segment customers based on: age [25,35,45,30,40], 
spending [1200,2500,800,1800,3200], frequency [12,25,8,15,30]. 
How many segments should I use?"

Claude: "I'll perform k-means clustering to identify customer segments."
[Claude calls kmeans_clustering with different k values]

Claude: "Optimal segmentation shows 3 distinct customer groups:
- Young High-Value (age~30, spend~$2650, freq~27)
- Mature Moderate (age~40, spend~$1500, freq~13) 
- Budget Conscious (age~45, spend~$800, freq~8)"
```

### Statistical Testing Workflow

**A/B Test Analysis**
```
You: "I ran an A/B test. Control conversion: [0.12, 0.11, 0.13, 0.10, 0.14]. 
Treatment conversion: [0.18, 0.19, 0.17, 0.20, 0.16]. Is the difference significant?"

Claude: "I'll run appropriate tests to evaluate your A/B test results."
[Claude calls t_test and normality_test]

Claude: "Treatment significantly outperforms control:
- Control: 12.0% conversion rate
- Treatment: 18.0% conversion rate  
- Lift: +50% improvement (p=0.003, 95% CI: [2.8%, 9.2%])
- Power analysis: 89% power to detect this effect size"
```
