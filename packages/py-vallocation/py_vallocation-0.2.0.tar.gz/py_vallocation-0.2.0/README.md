# Py-vAllocation

Py-vAllocation is a Python package for asset allocation with a primary focus on integrating investor views.

## Features

It's yet another portfolio optimization library, but unlike many others, **Py-vAllocation** aims to:
- Be modular and beginner-friendly with a simple API, while remaining flexible and customizable for advanced users  
- Avoid hidden assumptions or black-box components, every modeling choice is explicitly stated  
- Incorporate investor views via **fully flexible probabilities** using entropy pooling and the **Black-Litterman** methodology  
- Support **shrinkage** and other **Bayesian estimation** methods  
- Support **variance-based**, **scenario-based CVaR**, and **robust optimization models**
- Combine portfolios using **ensemble averaging** and **exposure stacking** to build diversified allocations across models

## Installation

You can install Py-vAllocation from PyPI using:

```bash
pip install py-vallocation
```

## Quick Start

See [examples here](examples/)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- numpy >= 1.20.0

## Development Status

**Alpha release**: Under active development. Many features are not yet implemented or fully tested. Breaking changes may occur without notice. Use at your own risk.
