Simple Photo Gallery is a simple command line tool written in Python that helps you create static HTML photo and video galleries that tell a story. Thumbnails, HTML, CSS and JavaScript files are generated automatically and can be uploaded to any static hosting, like for example [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The most important features:

- Responsive layout suitable for any device (including touch gestures support).
- Image captions extracted from the image metadata (EXIF tags).
- Fully customizable layout with sensible defaults to get started quickly.
- Create a gallery from an existing OneDrive or Google Photos album, without downloading the photos.
- Automatic upload of the gallery to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- Based on the [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) JavaScript library.

## Installation

Simple Photo Gallery can be easily installed with `pip`. If you don't have `pip`, please install the [latest Python release](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```
pip install simple-photo-gallery
```

It might be a really good idea to use a [Python virtual environment to install
simple-photo-gallery](doc/InstallWithVenv.md).

## Example Usage

You can quickly create a gallery with the default settings. For more detailed information see [Usage](https://github.com/haltakov/simple-photo-gallery/blob/master/doc/Usage.md).

1. Collect all the photos and videos you want to have in the gallery into a folder.
2. Open a terminal and go to the folder with your photos. Use the following command to initialize the gallery. The script will ask you a few questions, like gallery name or background image. You can always just press Enter for the default settings and change them later.

```
gallery-init
```

3. To generate the photos' thumbnails and to create the gallery HTML, CSS and JS files use the following command:

```
gallery-build
```

The gallery is ready! You can view it by opening the `index.html` file in the `public` folder. The `public` folder contains all the files you need for your gallery and you can host it on any static hosting provider.

> **Note**
> Your photos and videos are copied in `public/images/photos`.

4. Optionally, you can directly publish the gallery on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which offers a free plan.

See [Gallery Configuration](https://github.com/haltakov/simple-photo-gallery/blob/master/doc/GalleryConfiguration.md) for more details how you can customize your gallery. You can also find two example galleries in the [`examples`](https://github.com/haltakov/simple-photo-gallery/tree/master/examples) folder.

## Hosting

You can automatically upload the gallery to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

For Netlify you just need a free account and then you can run the following command to upload to a new website.

```
gallery-upload netlify
```

For AWS S3 you need to have [Amazon Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured and a bucket that can be accessed publicly (see the [AWS tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/) for hosting a static website).

```
gallery-upload aws s3://<your_bucket>/<path>/
```

You can upload your gallery manually on any static hosting provider, like for example [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or others. Some scripts for automatic upload of the gallery are under work.

## About

Simple Photo Gallery is developed by [Vladimir Haltakov](https://haltakov.net). I wanted an easy way to share photos with friends, but wasn't happy with the limited customization options that existing sharing solutions like Amazon Photos or iCloud offer.
