    Sends an asynchronous request. The type of request is determined by the value of `request_type` in `request_info` or

        The HTTP client used to send the request.

    Receives a list of dictionaries containing the request information. These dictionaries

    N connections to the endpoints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    list_requests : list of Request
    retries: int
        Number of attempts in case a request fails, each request can be executed up to (1+retries) times
