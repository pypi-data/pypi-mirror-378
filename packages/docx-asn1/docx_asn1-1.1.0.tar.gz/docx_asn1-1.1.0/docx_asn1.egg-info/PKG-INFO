Decode `asn1` from a docx file.

- question for [@3gpp](https://www.3gpp.org/): why `docx` from for the specification ?

## CLI

# download the docx
python -m pip install docx_asn1
python -m docx_asn1 file.docx output.asn1
# or
python -m docx_asn1 file.docx > output.asn1
```

## Python usage

from docx_asn1 import extract_text_from_docx

asn1 = extract_text_from_docx("file.docx")
```
