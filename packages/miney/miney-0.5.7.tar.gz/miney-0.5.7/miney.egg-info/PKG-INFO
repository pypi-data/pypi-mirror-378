# Miney - The python interface to Luanti

Miney is the Python API to Luanti/Minetest.

Miney connects locally, over network or internet with the Luanti protocol and provides a pythonic interface to the server, players, blocks and more.

* `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/miney/>`_

* `Luanti ContentDB <https://content.luanti.org/packages/Miney/miney/>`_

## Documentation

https://miney.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Status

**With version 0.5 we removed mineysocket and talking now directly to the server over the Luanti protocol!**

This is a major change and will break existing code! But it's also very cool, because you now only need the miney mod 
in the server and the "miney" python module. No special compiled server version and no mineysocket mod anymore! 
That makes it straightforward to install. Fast and easy, just like Python!

Miney is still in beta, so expect breaking changes.

## Requirement

* Python 3.6+ (tested on 3.12)
* Installed "miney" mod in the server.

# Development
