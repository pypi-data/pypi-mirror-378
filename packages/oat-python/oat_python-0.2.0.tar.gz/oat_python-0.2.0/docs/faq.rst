Contribute
----------------------

Community is the center of the OAT project. Open contributions are
welcome from anyone interested in computational topology and its applications --
that's the "O" in OAT!  See the our `contributing guidelines <https://github.com/OpenAppliedTopology/oat_python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_

History
----------------------

OAT began with a collaborative
research grant funded by the National Science Foundation in 2019 (NSF 1854748)
under the title `Exact Homological Algebra for Computational Topology (ExHACT) <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1854748&HistoricalAwards=false>`_.
This project had support from researchers at more than 20 institutions, including

- Brown University
- Columnbia University
- Florida Atlantic University
- Georgia Institute of Technology
- Intel Labs
- Macalester College
- Michigan State University
- Montana State University
- Oregon State University
- Penn State University
- Princeton University
- St. Olaf College
- SUNY Albany
- University of Arizona
- University of Delaware
- University of Oxford
- University of Pennsylvania
- Wesleyan University

The lead institutions for this early stage of the work where

- `Princeton University <https://www.princeton.edu>`_ (later University of Oxford)
- `Macalester College <https://www.macalester.edu>`_
- `University of Delaware <https://www.udel.edu>`_ (later University of Oregon)

In 2022, 

- `Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) <https://www.pnnl.gov>`_

took over as the lead contributor to
for the project, and PNNL now coordinates development of OAT.
