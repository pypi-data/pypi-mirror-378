suite = await TradingSuite.create("MNQ")
data = await suite.data.get_data("5min")  # Direct access

# New (v3.5.0) - Multi-instrument with backward compatibility
suite = await TradingSuite.create(["MNQ"])  # List notation

## [3.4.0] - 2025-08-28

### üöÄ New Feature: ETH vs RTH Trading Sessions (Experimental)

**IMPORTANT**: This is an experimental feature that has not been thoroughly tested with live market data. Use with caution in production environments.

This release introduces comprehensive trading session filtering, allowing you to separate Electronic Trading Hours (ETH) from Regular Trading Hours (RTH) for more precise market analysis and strategy execution.

### ‚ú® Added

- **SessionFilterMixin**: High-performance data filtering with caching and lazy evaluation
- **Session-Aware Indicators**: Calculate technical indicators on session-specific data
- **Session Statistics**: Separate performance metrics for ETH vs RTH periods
- **Maintenance Break Exclusion**: Automatically filters out daily maintenance periods (5-6 PM ET)

**TradingSuite Integration**:
- New `session_config` parameter for automatic session filtering
- Seamless integration with existing components (OrderManager, PositionManager, DataManager)
- Backward compatible - defaults to BOTH sessions when not specified

**Example Usage**:
```python
# RTH-only trading (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
rth_suite = await TradingSuite.create(
    "MNQ",
    timeframes=["1min", "5min"],
    session_config=SessionConfig(session_type=SessionType.RTH)
)

# ETH-only analysis (excludes RTH and maintenance breaks)
eth_suite = await TradingSuite.create(
    "ES",
    session_config=SessionConfig(session_type=SessionType.ETH)
)
```

stats = suite.orders.get_order_statistics()  # Synchronous
suite_stats = await suite.get_stats()        # Async

# New (v3.3.0) - All async
stats = await suite.orders.get_stats()       # Now async
suite_stats = await suite.get_stats()        # Still async
```

**2. Replace Old Statistics Mixins**
```python
# Old (v3.2.x)
from project_x_py.utils import EnhancedStatsTrackingMixin

class MyComponent(EnhancedStatsTrackingMixin):
    pass

# New (v3.3.0)
from project_x_py.statistics import BaseStatisticsTracker

class MyComponent(BaseStatisticsTracker):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
```

**3. Use New Export Capabilities**
```python
# New in v3.3.0 - Multi-format export
prometheus_metrics = await suite.export_stats("prometheus")
csv_data = await suite.export_stats("csv")
datadog_metrics = await suite.export_stats("datadog")
```

- **Utility Functions**:
  - `setup_logging()` for consistent logging
  - `get_env_var()` for environment variable handling
  - `format_price()` and `format_volume()` for display
  - `is_market_hours()` for market timing
  - `RateLimiter` class for API rate limiting

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Restructured package imports - use `from project_x_py import ProjectX` instead of importing from `__init__.py`
- **Breaking**: Configuration now uses `ProjectXConfig` dataclass instead of hardcoded values

## Release Notes

### Upgrading to v0.2.0

If you're upgrading from v0.1.0, please note the following breaking changes:

1. **Import Changes**:
   ```python
   # Old (v0.1.0)
   from project_x_py import ProjectX

   # New (v0.2.0) - same import, but underlying structure changed
   from project_x_py import ProjectX  # Still works
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Required (same as before)
   export PROJECT_X_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   export PROJECT_X_USERNAME="your_username"

   # New optional configuration variables
   export PROJECTX_API_URL="https://api.topstepx.com/api"
   export PROJECTX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS="30"
   export PROJECTX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS="3"
   ```

3. **Client Initialization**:
   ```python
   # Recommended new approach
   client = ProjectX.from_env()  # Uses environment variables

   # Or with explicit credentials (same as before)
   client = ProjectX(username="user", api_key="key")

   # Or with custom configuration
   config = ProjectXConfig(timeout_seconds=60)
   client = ProjectX.from_env(config=config)
   ```

4. **Error Handling**:
   ```python
   # New specific exception types
   try:
       client = ProjectX.from_env()
       account = client.get_account_info()
   except ProjectXAuthenticationError:
       print("Authentication failed")
   except ProjectXServerError:
       print("Server error")
   except ProjectXError:
       print("General ProjectX error")
   ```

### Migration Guide

1. **Update imports**: No changes needed - existing imports still work
2. **Update error handling**: Consider using specific exception types
3. **Use new factory methods**: `ProjectX.from_env()` is now recommended
4. **Optional**: Set up configuration file for advanced settings
5. **Optional**: Use new utility functions for logging and formatting

### New Installation Options

```bash
# Basic installation (same as before)
pip install project-x-py

# With real-time features
pip install project-x-py[realtime]

# With development tools
pip install project-x-py[dev]

# Everything
pip install project-x-py[all]
```
