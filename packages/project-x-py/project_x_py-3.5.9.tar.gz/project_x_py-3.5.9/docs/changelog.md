## [3.5.7] - 2025-02-02

### üêõ Fixed

**Order Placement**:
- **Decimal Serialization**: Fixed JSON serialization error when placing orders with Decimal prices
- **API Compatibility**: Ensured all price values are properly converted to float for API requests
- **Price Precision**: Maintained internal Decimal precision while ensuring JSON compatibility

### üìö Documentation

**Examples**:
- **Quick Start Example**: Fixed and verified the quick_start.py example in Documentation_Examples
- **Order Placement**: Ensured all documentation examples work with the fixed serialization

## [3.5.6] - 2025-02-02

### üêõ Fixed

**Multi-Instrument Event System**:
- **Event Forwarding**: Implemented event forwarding from instrument-specific EventBuses to suite-level EventBus
- **InstrumentContext Methods**: Added `on()`, `once()`, `off()`, and `wait_for()` methods that delegate to event_bus
- **Event Propagation**: Fixed broken event system that prevented `mnq_context.wait_for(EventType.NEW_BAR)` from working
- **Multi-Instrument Support**: Events now properly flow from individual instruments to the suite level

**Bracket Order Improvements**:
- **Automatic Price Alignment**: Changed validation from failing to auto-aligning prices to tick size
- **Smart Adjustment**: Orders with misaligned prices are now automatically corrected instead of rejected
- **Better UX**: Improved user experience by handling price alignment transparently

## [3.4.0] - 2025-08-28

### üöÄ New Feature: ETH vs RTH Trading Sessions (Experimental)

**IMPORTANT**: This is an experimental feature that has not been thoroughly tested with live market data. Use with caution in production environments.

This release introduces comprehensive trading session filtering, allowing you to separate Electronic Trading Hours (ETH) from Regular Trading Hours (RTH) for more precise market analysis and strategy execution.

### Added
- **Trading Sessions Module** (`src/project_x_py/sessions/`) with SessionConfig, SessionFilterMixin, and session-aware components
- **TradingSuite Integration** with new `session_config` parameter
- **Session-Aware Indicators** for calculating technical indicators on session-specific data
- **Session Statistics** for separate ETH vs RTH performance metrics
- **Maintenance Break Exclusion** (5-6 PM ET daily)
- **Comprehensive Example** in `examples/sessions/16_eth_vs_rth_sessions_demo.py`
- **Documentation** in `docs/guide/sessions.md`

### Known Limitations
- Session boundaries may need adjustment based on contract specifications
- Overnight session handling requires further testing
- Performance impact with large datasets not fully optimized
- Some futures products may have non-standard session times
