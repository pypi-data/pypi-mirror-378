Pythonic FP - Sentinels
=======================

PyPI project
`pythonic-fp-sentinels
<https://pypi.org/project/pythonic-fp.sentinels>`_ **(DEPRICATED)**.

Singleton classes representing

- missing values, actually missing, not potentially missing
- sentinel values of different flavors

This PyPI project has been **DEPRICATED** and all its source code
has been moved to the pythonic-fp-gadgets PyPI project.
Both projects are part of of the grscheller
`pythonic-fp namespace projects
<https://github.com/grscheller/pythonic-fp/blob/main/README.md>`_.

The reason of the move was to make all the gadgets code independent
of any external dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.
The two pythonic_fp.sentinel modules, ``flavored`` and ``novalue``
are more or less feature complete and are not likely to change much
in the future.
