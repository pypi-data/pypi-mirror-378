# SBMLNetwork

SBMLNetwork is a python package designed to visualize and edit SBML model networks. It uses libsbmlnetwork package, which employs an embedded force-directed autolayout algorithm to create aesthetically pleasing networks and utilizes SBML Layout and Render packages to store and retrieve visualization information of models. With its drawing tool and its comprehensive command-line API, users can generate and modify graphical representations of their SBML models, save the visual information of their model to SBML files or strings, and export rendered figures of their model in PDF, PNG, and JPG formats.
