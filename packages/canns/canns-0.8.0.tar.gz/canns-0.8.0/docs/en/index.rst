About CANNs
-----------

Continuous Attractor Neural Networks (CANNs) are a class of neural network models characterized by their ability to maintain stable activity patterns in continuous state spaces. This library provides:

- **Rich Model Library**: 1D/2D CANNs, SFA models, hierarchical networks
- **Task-Oriented Design**: Path integration, smooth tracking, custom tasks
- **Powerful Analysis Tools**: Real-time visualization, statistical analysis
- **High Performance**: JAX-based computation with GPU/TPU support

Quick Installation
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   # Basic installation (CPU)
   pip install canns
   
   # GPU support (Linux)
   pip install canns[cuda12]
   
   # TPU support (Linux)  
   pip install canns[tpu]

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   import brainstate
   from canns.models.basic import CANN1D
   from canns.task.tracking import SmoothTracking1D
   
   # Create 1D CANN network
   cann = CANN1D(num=512)
   cann.init_state()
   
   # Define smooth tracking task
   task = SmoothTracking1D(
       cann_instance=cann,
       Iext=(1., 0.75, 2., 1.75, 3.),
       duration=(10., 10., 10., 10.),
   )
