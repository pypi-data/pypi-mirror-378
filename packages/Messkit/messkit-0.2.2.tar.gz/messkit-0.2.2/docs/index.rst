Got a mess goin' on?  There's a kit for that...

Messkit aims to be a "custom app in a box" for operational data
management, automation etc.  Sort of like a spreadsheet on sterroids,
where the user defines the data layout and behavior as much as
possible.

It comes with several tables to store commonly-needed data, but the
goal is to provide an easy interface to add extra tables (and
importers!) etc. as needed.

For now Messkit is very much a work in progress!  But nearly all of
the underlying tech has been in production for years, so is quite
stable.  Installation is quick and painless (as is upgrading) so get
started today and enjoy the evolution...
