# Remote Tool - Compliance Checklist

**Status**: ‚úÖ **SPECIAL CASE - COMPLIANT BY DESIGN**  
**Priority**: LOW - Tool follows different patterns by necessity

## üéØ Tool Purpose

The `remote` tool is a **universal connector** for external MCP services and intentionally follows different patterns than standard tools.

## ‚úÖ Why This Tool is Different (and Correct)

### Design Rationale
- **Universal Adapter**: Connects to any external MCP service
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Cannot pre-define agents/workflows for unknown services
- **Proxy Behavior**: Acts as a pass-through rather than standalone tool
- **Manual Setup**: All instructions must be provided when configuring

### Expected Missing Files
- ‚ùå `agents.yaml` - Cannot pre-define agents for unknown services
- ‚ùå `workflows.yaml` - Cannot pre-define workflows for dynamic services  
- ‚ùå `template.md` - Instructions depend on target service
- ‚ùå `readme.md` - Usage varies by target service

## üìù Tool-Specific Compliance

### ‚úÖ Already Compliant

- [x] Has `main.py` with `RemoteMCPTool` class
- [x] Has `_bypass_pydantic = True`
- [x] Inherits from `BaseTool`
- [x] Implements required `run` method
- [x] Uses standardized error responses

### Tool Usage Pattern
```python
# Agent must specify all instructions manually
agents:
  remote_service_agent:
    model: "gpt-4o"
    instructions: |
      You are connecting to remote service: {service_url}
      
      Available operations:
      - operation1: description
      - operation2: description
      
      Authentication: {auth_method}
      Rate limits: {limits}
      
      # All service-specific instructions here
    
    tools:
      - remote
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional Improvements

### 1. Generic Documentation
- [ ] Consider creating generic `readme.md` explaining remote tool concept
- [ ] Document how to configure agents for remote services
- [ ] Provide examples of common remote service integrations

### 2. Template Guidance
- [ ] Create `template.md` with generic remote service instructions
- [ ] Include placeholder patterns for common operations
- [ ] Document authentication patterns

## üìù Potential readme.md Content

If documentation is added, it should focus on:

```markdown
# Remote MCP Tool

Universal connector for external MCP services.

## Purpose

The remote tool enables LangSwarm to connect to any external MCP service without requiring custom tool implementations.

## Configuration

Since this tool connects to dynamic services, all configuration must be provided manually:

```yaml
agents:
  my_remote_agent:
    model: "gpt-4o"
    instructions: |
      # Service-specific instructions here
      Connect to: {service_url}
      Operations: {operation_list}
      Auth: {auth_method}
    tools:
      - remote
```

## Usage Examples

[Examples of connecting to different services]

## Best Practices

- Always specify complete service documentation in agent instructions
- Include authentication requirements
- Document rate limits and constraints
- Provide error code explanations
```

## üß™ Testing Considerations

- [ ] Test connections to various external MCP services
- [ ] Verify error handling for connection failures
- [ ] Test authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Validate proxy behavior

## üìÖ Implementation Priority

1. **OPTIONAL**: Generic documentation for user guidance
2. **OPTIONAL**: Template for common remote service patterns
3. **LOW**: Advanced proxy features

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] Tool correctly proxies to external MCP services
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Documentation (if added) explains the universal connector concept
- [ ] Users understand how to configure for different services

## üîç Special Considerations

### Why Standard Files Don't Apply

1. **agents.yaml**: Cannot predefine agents for unknown services
2. **workflows.yaml**: Cannot predefine workflows for dynamic operations
3. **template.md**: Instructions are service-specific
4. **readme.md**: Usage patterns vary by target service

### Compliance Exception

This tool is **exempt** from standard file requirements due to its universal adapter nature. The absence of standard files is intentional and correct.

**Estimated Work**: 2-3 hours (optional documentation only)  
**Risk Level**: None (tool functions correctly as designed)  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Special Status**: Compliant by design exception
