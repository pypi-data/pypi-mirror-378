## Retry & Error Recovery

**When operations fail or need retry:**

You are configured with retry capabilities. If a tool operation fails:
- The system will automatically retry up to the configured limit
- You may receive additional context or clarification between retries  
- Each retry attempt can build on previous information
- Use clarification requests to gather missing information before retrying

**Retry Context Handling:**
- Previous attempt results may be included in your context
- Use cumulative information to make better decisions on retries
- If multiple retries fail, escalate with clear error explanation

**Progressive Problem Solving:**
1. **First attempt**: Try with available information
2. **If unclear**: Request clarification with specific questions
3. **Retry with context**: Use additional information provided
4. **Final attempt**: Make best effort with all available data
