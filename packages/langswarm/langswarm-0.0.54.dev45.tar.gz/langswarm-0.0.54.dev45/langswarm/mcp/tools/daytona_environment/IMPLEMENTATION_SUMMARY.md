## üöÄ Usage Patterns

### Natural Language Interface
```yaml
# Environment management
"Create a Python development environment for machine learning"
"Set up a Node.js sandbox with TypeScript support"
"List all my current development environments"

# Code execution
"Run this Python script safely in a sandbox"
"Execute npm test in my development environment"
"Test this code snippet in an isolated environment"

# File operations
"Upload my project files to the sandbox"
"Read the contents of main.py"
"Download the generated report"

# Git operations
"Clone my repository into a new environment"
"Commit and push the changes"
"Check git status"
```

### Direct API Interface
```python
# Environment creation
{
    "method": "create_sandbox",
    "params": {
        "language": "python",
        "name": "ml-project",
        "git_repo": "https://github.com/user/repo.git",
        "persistent": true
    }
}

# Code execution
{
    "method": "execute_code",
    "params": {
        "sandbox_id": "sandbox-abc123",
        "code": "print('Hello, Daytona!')",
        "language": "python"
    }
}
```

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Dependencies Added
- Added `daytona = {version = "^0.10.5", optional = true}` to `pyproject.toml`

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
export DAYTONA_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export DAYTONA_API_URL="https://app.daytona.io"  # optional
```

### Configuration Example
```yaml

  - id: daytona_env
    type: daytona_environment
    description: "Secure development environments with Daytona"
    local_mode: true
    pattern: "intent"
    main_workflow: "use_daytona_environment_tool"
    permission: anonymous
