# Realtime Voice Tool - Compliance Checklist

**Status**: ⚠️ **MISSING WORKFLOWS**  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Missing core workflow infrastructure

## 🚨 Critical Issues

### 1. Missing Workflow Infrastructure
- [ ] **Create `workflows.yaml`** - No workflow definitions exist
- [ ] **Verify agent-workflow integration** - Agents exist but no workflows to use them

## 📝 Required Changes

### 1. Create workflows.yaml
```yaml
workflows:
  - id: main_voice_workflow
    description: "Primary workflow for realtime voice operations"
    steps:
      - id: validate_voice_request
        agent: voice_input_processor
        input: |
          user_input: ${user_input}
          user_query: ${user_query}
        output:
          to: validated_request

      - id: process_voice_operation
        agent: realtime_voice_manager
        input: |
          Voice request: ${context.step_outputs.validate_voice_request}
          
          Process this realtime voice operation safely.
        output:
          to: voice_result

      - id: format_voice_response
        agent: voice_response_formatter
        input: |
          Voice result: ${context.step_outputs.process_voice_operation}
          Original request: ${context.step_outputs.validate_voice_request}
        output:
          to: user
```

## ✅ Already Compliant

- [x] Has most required files: `main.py`, `agents.yaml`, `readme.md`, `template.md`
- [x] Class name follows convention: `RealtimeVoiceMCPTool`
- [x] Has `_bypass_pydantic = True`
- [x] Documentation files are lowercase
- [x] Good agent configuration structure
- [x] Uses `gpt-4o` models (optimal)

## ⚠️ Files Status

- [x] `main.py` - Present ✅
- [x] `agents.yaml` - Present ✅
- [ ] `workflows.yaml` - **Missing** ❌
- [x] `readme.md` - Present ✅
- [x] `template.md` - Present ✅
- [x] `__init__.py` - Present ✅

## 🔍 Agent Analysis

### ✅ Good Agent Setup
- Agents use optimal `gpt-4o` models
- Specialized roles defined
- Good instruction quality
- Appropriate response modes

### 🔧 Workflow Integration Needed
The agents are well-defined but cannot be used without workflows:
- `voice_input_processor` - Ready for workflow integration
- `realtime_voice_manager` - Ready for workflow integration  
- `voice_response_formatter` - Ready for workflow integration

## 🧪 Testing Required

After creating workflows:
- [ ] Test voice input processing
- [ ] Verify realtime capabilities
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios
- [ ] Validate agent interactions
- [ ] Test workflow execution

## 📅 Implementation Priority

1. **HIGH**: Create `workflows.yaml` with agent integration
2. **MEDIUM**: Test workflow functionality
3. **LOW**: Enhance documentation if needed

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] `workflows.yaml` exists and follows standards
- [ ] Agents are properly integrated into workflows
- [ ] Voice operations execute successfully
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Real-time capabilities function properly

## 📋 Workflow Template

Based on existing agents, the workflow should:

1. **Process voice input** using `voice_input_processor`
2. **Execute voice operations** using `realtime_voice_manager`
3. **Format responses** using `voice_response_formatter`
4. **Handle errors** gracefully
5. **Support real-time streaming** if applicable

## 💡 Design Considerations

- **Real-time Requirements**: Ensure workflows support streaming
- **Error Handling**: Voice operations can fail uniquely
- **Performance**: Minimize latency for real-time use
- **Resource Management**: Handle audio processing efficiently

**Estimated Work**: 2-3 hours (workflow creation and testing)  
**Risk Level**: Medium (missing core functionality)  
**Dependencies**: Existing agents are ready for integration
