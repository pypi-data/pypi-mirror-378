# Tasklist Tool - Compliance Checklist

**Status**: ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLIANT**  
**Priority**: LOW - Minor improvements only

## ✅ Already Compliant

- [x] Has all required files: `main.py`, `agents.yaml`, `workflows.yaml`, `readme.md`, `template.md`
- [x] Class name follows convention: `TasklistMCPTool`
- [x] Has `_bypass_pydantic = True`
- [x] Uses standardized error responses
- [x] Documentation files are lowercase
- [x] Modern workflow patterns
- [x] Proper step references
- [x] Uses modern `output: to:` format
- [x] Comprehensive agent configuration
- [x] Good documentation structure

## ⚠️ Minor Optimizations

### 1. Agent Model Verification
- [ ] Verify all agents use optimal models
  - Most agents appear well-configured
  - Check for any `gpt-4` that could be upgraded to `gpt-4o`

### 2. Workflow Enhancement
- [ ] Review workflow complexity for potential simplification
- [ ] Consider consolidating similar workflows if any exist
- [ ] Validate error handling workflows are complete

### 3. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Review `UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - may contain outdated information
- [ ] Ensure readme.md reflects current capabilities
- [ ] Verify examples are current and working

## 🔍 Code Quality Assessment

### ✅ Strong Points
- Well-structured agent definitions
- Multiple workflow options for different task operations
- Comprehensive task management capabilities
- Good separation of concerns
- Error handling workflows implemented

### 🔧 Potential Improvements
- [ ] Verify all task operations are documented
- [ ] Check for any deprecated patterns
- [ ] Ensure error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Validate input handling for edge cases

## 📋 File Review Status

### UPDATE_SUMMARY.md Analysis
- [ ] Review if `UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` is still relevant
- [ ] Consider archiving if outdated
- [ ] Update if it contains current information
- [ ] Ensure it doesn't conflict with main documentation

### Workflow Complexity
- [ ] Review if multiple workflows can be simplified
- [ ] Check for duplicate functionality
- [ ] Ensure each workflow has a clear purpose
- [ ] Validate workflow routing logic

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

- [ ] Test all task operations (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Verify error handling for invalid inputs
- [ ] Test workflow execution paths
- [ ] Validate agent responses are appropriate

## 📅 Implementation Priority

1. **LOW**: Review and update documentation
2. **LOW**: Verify model configurations
3. **OPTIONAL**: Simplify workflows if possible
4. **OPTIONAL**: Archive outdated files

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] All documentation is current and accurate
- [ ] All agents use optimal model configurations
- [ ] Workflows are streamlined and efficient
- [ ] No deprecated patterns remain
- [ ] All task operations work correctly
