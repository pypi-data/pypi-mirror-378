Extract complete competition discussions with hierarchical reply structure, author metadata, rankings, and full content preservation.

### 2. 🏆 Writeup Extraction
Extract top-performing writeups directly from competition leaderboards with team information, rankings, and complete solution details in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, JSON).

### 3. 📓 Code Notebook Extraction
Extract competition code notebooks, download them via Kaggle API, and convert them to Python files using nbconvert. Includes metadata preservation and automatic organization.

### Key Capabilities
- **Complete Content Preservation**: No trimming or content loss
- **Hierarchical Comments**: Proper reply nesting (1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc.)
- **Leaderboard Integration**: Direct extraction from competition leaderboards
- **Team Detection**: Multi-member team writeup handling
- **Rich Metadata**: Author info, rankings, timestamps, upvotes, badges
