# BitBully

**BitBully** is a high-performance Connect-4 solver built using C++ and Python bindings, leveraging advanced algorithms
and optimized bitwise operations. It provides tools for solving and analyzing Connect-4 games efficiently, designed for
both developers and researchers.

## Features

- **Fast Solver**: Implements MTD(f) and null-window search algorithms for Connect-4.
- **Bitboard Representation**: Efficiently manages board states using bitwise operations.
- **Advanced Features**: Includes transposition tables, threat detection, and move prioritization.
- **Python Bindings**: Exposes core functionality through the `bitbully_core` Python module using `pybind11`.
- **Cross-Platform**: Build and run on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- **Open-Source**: Fully accessible codebase for learning and contribution.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher, PyPy 3.10 or higher

---

## Build and Install

### From PyPI (Recommended)

The easiest way to install the BitBully package is via PyPI:

```bash
pip install bitbully
```

This will automatically download and install the pre-built package, including the Python bindings.

## Usage

### Start with a simple Widget on Colab

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/MarkusThill/BitBully/blob/master/notebooks/gameWidget.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

### BitBully Lib (recommended)

tbd
Also add a simple Notebook with examples!

### BitBully Core (advanced)

Use the `BitBully` and `Board` classes directly in Python:

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core
import time

board = bitbully_core.BoardCore()

# Yellow and red alternately play moves into column 3 (center column):
for _ in range(6):
    board.playMove(3)

print(board)

solver = bitbully_core.BitBully()
start = time.perf_counter()
score = solver.mtdf(board, first_guess=0)
print(f"Time: {round(time.perf_counter() - start, 2)} seconds!")
print(f"Best score: {score}")
```

You can initialize a board using an array with shape `(7, 6)` (columns first) and solve it:

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core

# Define a Connect-4 board as an array (7 columns x 6 rows)
# You may also define the board using a numpy array if numpy is installed
# 0 = Empty, 1 = Yellow, 2 = Red
board_array = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

# Convert the array to the BitBully board
board = bitbully_core.BoardCore()
assert board.setBoard(board_array), "Invalid board!"

print(board)

# Solve the position
solver = bitbully_core.BitBully()
score = solver.mtdf(board, first_guess=0)
print(f"Best score for the current board: {score}") # expected score: 1
```

Run the Bitbully solver with an opening book (here: 12-ply opening book with winning distances):

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core as bbc
import importlib.resources

db_path = importlib.resources.files("bitbully").joinpath("assets/book_12ply_distances.dat")
bitbully = bbc.BitBully(db_path)
b = bbc.BoardCore()  # Empty board
bitbully.scoreMoves(b)  # expected result: [-2, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, -2]
```

Generate a random board with `n` tokens:

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core as bbc

# Create a random board (and the move sequence that generated it)
b, move_list = bbc.BoardCore.randomBoard(12, True)
print(b)
print(move_list)
```

### Further Usage Examples for BitBully Core

Create all Positions with (up to) `n` tokens starting from Board `b`:

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core as bbc

b = bbc.BoardCore()  # empty board
board_list_3ply = b.allPositions(3, True)  # All positions with exactly 3 tokens
len(board_list_3ply)  # should be 238 according to https://oeis.org/A212693
```

Find the game-theoretic value of a 12-ply position using an opening book:

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core as bbc
import importlib.resources

db_path = importlib.resources.files("bitbully").joinpath("assets/book_12ply_distances.dat")
ob = bbc.OpeningBookCore(db_path)
b, move_list = bbc.BoardCore.randomBoard(12, True)  # get a board without an immediate threat for Yellow
assert ob.isInBook(b) or ob.isInBook(b.mirror())  # Either position `b` or its mirrored equivalent are in the DB
ob.getBoardValue(b)  # Get game-theoretic value (also checks mirrored board)
```
