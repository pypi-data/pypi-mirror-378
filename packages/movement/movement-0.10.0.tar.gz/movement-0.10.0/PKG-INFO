# movement

A Python toolbox for analysing animal body movements across space and time.


![](docs/source/_static/movement_overview.png)

## Quick install

Create and activate a conda environment with movement installed (including the GUI):
```bash
conda create -n movement-env -c conda-forge movement napari pyqt
conda activate movement-env
```


> [!Note]
> Read the [documentation](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev) for more information, including [full installation instructions](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/user_guide/installation.html) and [examples](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/examples/index.html).

## Overview

Deep learning methods for motion tracking have revolutionised a range of
scientific disciplines, from neuroscience and biomechanics, to conservation
and ethology. Tools such as
[DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) and
[SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) now allow researchers to track animal movements
in videos with remarkable accuracy, without requiring physical markers.
However, there is still a need for standardised, easy-to-use methods
to process the tracks generated by these tools.

`movement` aims to provide a consistent, modular interface for analysing
motion tracks, enabling steps such as data cleaning, visualisation,
and motion quantification. We aim to support all popular animal tracking
frameworks and file formats.

> [!Tip]
> If you prefer analysing your data in R, we recommend checking out the
> [animovement](https://roald-arboel.com/animovement/) toolbox, which is similar in scope.
> We are working together with its developer
> to gradually converge on common data standards and workflows.
