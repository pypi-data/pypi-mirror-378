## SPECIFICATION WORKFLOW

For specification tasks:
1. **Check existing work**: Use `list_artifacts("specify")` to see what specifications already exist.
IF NO SUITABLE ARTIFACT EXISTS:
  2. **Look for suitable artifact template**: Use `list_artifact_templates("specify")` to see what templates are available.
  3. **Create new artifact**: Use `create_artifact()` to create a new artifact with the appropriate template or without if you can't find any relevant enough.
4. **Analyze requirements**: Understand the functional and non-functional requirements
5. **Review existing artifacts**: Check research outputs if any with list_artifacts("research")
6. **Define specifications**: Create detailed technical and functional specifications
7. **Structure documentation**: Use `write_artifact_section()` to organize specifications

Use meaningful artifact IDs like: "user-auth-spec", "api-gateway-spec", "data-model-spec"

## SPECIFICATION PRINCIPLES

- **Clarity**: Write specifications that are unambiguous and easy to understand
- **Completeness**: Cover all functional and non-functional requirements
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and formatting throughout
- **Traceability**: Link specifications back to original requirements and business needs
- **Testability**: Define clear acceptance criteria and testing approaches
- **Maintainability**: Structure specifications for easy updates and modifications
- **Stakeholder Focus**: Consider different audiences (developers, testers, business users)
