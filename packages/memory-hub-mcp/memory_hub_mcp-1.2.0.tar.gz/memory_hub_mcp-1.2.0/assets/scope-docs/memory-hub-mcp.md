**Context & Scope Document: Local Memory Hub MCP Server**

**Project ID:** `memory-hub-mcp`
**Ticket ID:** `MH-MCP-CORE-BUILD`

**I. Overall Vision & "The Why":**

The primary objective is to create a high-performance, locally-hosted "Memory Hub" to serve as an intelligent, persistent context store for AI engineering agents operating within Cursor. This system will replace reliance on slower, remote memory services (like the current mem0/OpenMemory) and static markdown files for context management.

The core drivers are:

1.  **Reduce Latency:** Eliminate the 5-10 second delays experienced with remote memory services by leveraging a local network and the powerful Mac Studio (M3 Ultra, 96GB RAM).
2.  **Enhance Agent Autonomy:** Enable agents to more intelligently and independently manage context (storing plans, decisions, learnings; retrieving relevant information) with minimal human intervention beyond initial task definition (`project_id`, `ticket_id`).
3.  **Improve Context Quality:** Utilize local LLMs (Gemma3-4b for summarization, Nomic for embeddings) and advanced chunking (`semchunk`) to store and retrieve more semantically rich and relevant information.
4.  **Foundation for "Next Echelon" AI Development:** Create a robust local infrastructure piece that can support more sophisticated agentic workflows in the future.

This Memory Hub will be exposed as an MCP server, making its services (adding memories, searching memories) available as tools to Cursor agents.

NOTE on local development:
- This feature is going to live on Matt's Mac Studio. However this code is being developed over the `Remote - SSH` extension for Cursor, on his Macbook Pro. 
- So when running any terminal commands, keep that in mind, that you are located on the MBP, not on the Studio, and while you have access to the Studio's terminal via this extension, you're not truly on it.
- Before you do any Python terminal work, you need to run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.

**II. Core Local Infrastructure & Tools (Mac Studio):**

- **LLM Serving:** LM Studio
  - **Embedding Model:** `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5` (served at `http://localhost:1234/v1/embeddings`). Context window: 8192 tokens. Embedding size: 768.
  - **Reasoning/Summarization Model:** `google/gemma-3-4b` (served at `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`).
- **Vector Database:** Qdrant (running locally via Docker, accessible at `http://localhost:6333`).
  - **Storage Volume:** Mounted at `~/Dev/Agentic-Squad/data/qdrant_storage`
- **Text Chunking:** `semchunk` library (to be integrated into the Python service).
- **API Framework:** FastAPI.
- **MCP Server Integration:** `fastapi-mcp` library.

**III. High-Level Plan & Key System Capabilities:**

The system will consist of a FastAPI application running on the Mac Studio, wrapped by `fastapi-mcp` to expose it as a Cursor-compatible MCP server.

[X] **Step 1: FastAPI Application - Core Memory Hub Logic**

- **Objective:** Create the Python FastAPI application that implements the core functionality of adding and searching memories.
- **Reasoning:** FastAPI provides a modern, fast way to build APIs. This will be the engine of our Memory Hub.

  [X] - **Sub-Step 1.1: Project Setup & Dependencies**

  - **Action:** Initialize a new Python project. Install `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `qdrant-client`, `httpx`, `pydantic`, and `semchunk`.
  - **Suggestion:** Use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Successfully set up uv-managed project with all dependencies including `fastapi-mcp==0.3.4`.
    [X] - **Sub-Step 1.2: Qdrant Collection Initialization**
  - **Action:** Implement logic within the FastAPI app (e.g., in an `on_event("startup")` handler) to connect to the local Qdrant instance and create the designated collection (e.g., `ai_memory_hub_v1`) if it doesn't already exist.
  - **Configuration:** The collection should be configured with vector parameters matching the Nomic embedding model (size 768, cosine distance).
  - **Reasoning:** Ensures the database is ready when the API starts.
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Implemented in lifespan manager with proper error handling and collection creation.
    [X] - **Sub-Step 1.3: `/add_memory` Endpoint Implementation**
  - **Input:** `MemoryItemIn` Pydantic model (containing `content: str` and `metadata: dict`). Metadata must include `project_id`, `ticket_id`, `type`, and should include `version`, `timestamp_iso`, `keywords`.
  - **Processing:**
    1.  **(STUB for Future) Intelligent Pre-processing (Optional):** Include a placeholder comment for where Gemma (or similar model) could be used to analyze incoming `content` to suggest better `keywords` or generate an abstract before chunking.
    2.  **Chunking:** Use `semchunk` to split the input `content` into semantically coherent text chunks. Each chunk should be small enough for the embedding model.
    3.  **Embedding:** For each chunk, make an asynchronous HTTP call to the LM Studio Nomic embedding model endpoint (`/v1/embeddings`) to get its vector embedding.
    4.  **Storage:** Upsert each chunk as a separate point into the Qdrant collection. Each point must have:
        - A unique ID (e.g., `uuid.uuid4()`).
        - Its vector embedding.
        - A `payload` containing:
          - The `text_chunk` itself.
          - A copy of the original `metadata` provided in the request.
          - Additional chunk-specific metadata: `original_content_hash` (hash of the full input content), `chunk_index`, `total_chunks`.
  - **Output:** Confirmation message, number of chunks stored, `original_content_hash`.
  - **Reasoning:** This endpoint is the primary way new information enters the Memory Hub. Robust chunking, embedding, and metadata storage are critical.
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Implemented with semchunk integration, Nomic embeddings, and robust error handling.
    [X] - **Sub-Step 1.4: `/search_memories` Endpoint Implementation**
  - **Input:** `MemorySearchRequest` Pydantic model (containing `query_text: str`, optional `metadata_filters: dict`, `limit: int`).
  - **Processing:**
    1.  **Query Embedding:** Get the vector embedding for the `query_text` by calling the LM Studio Nomic embedding endpoint.
    2.  **Vector Search:** Perform a search in the Qdrant collection using the query embedding and applying any provided `metadata_filters` (e.g., filter by `project_id`, `ticket_id`, `type`). Retrieve top N results with their payloads and scores.
    3.  **Gemma Summarization/Synthesis (Enhancement):** Take the top N retrieved chunks. Send their text content and metadata to the LM Studio Gemma 3 4b model endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`) with a carefully crafted prompt asking it to synthesize a concise summary that directly addresses the original `query_text` in the context of the `project_id` and `ticket_id`.
    4.  **Output:** `SearchResponse` Pydantic model, containing the `synthesized_summary` (if successful) and the raw `retrieved_chunks` (for reference or if summarization fails/is skipped).
  - **Reasoning:** This endpoint allows agents to retrieve relevant context. The Gemma summarization step aims to provide more direct, actionable insights rather than just raw data.
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Implemented with vector search, metadata filtering, and Gemma-3-4b synthesis.
    [X] - **Sub-Step 1.5: Error Handling & Logging**
  - **Action:** Implement robust error handling (e.g., for Qdrant connection issues, LM Studio API errors, chunking failures) and basic logging throughout the FastAPI app.
  - **Reasoning:** Essential for debugging and understanding the behavior of the service.
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Comprehensive logging and error handling implemented throughout all endpoints.

[X] **Step 2: `fastapi-mcp` Integration**

- **Objective:** Expose the FastAPI application as a Cursor-compatible MCP server.
- **Reasoning:** `fastapi-mcp` handles the complexities of the MCP protocol, including the SSE endpoint, tool registration, and message passing.

  [X] - **Sub-Step 2.1: Install `fastapi-mcp`**

  - **Action:** `pip install fastapi-mcp`.
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Installed via uv as part of initial setup.
    [X] - **Sub-Step 2.2: Adapt `main.py` for `fastapi-mcp`**
  - **Action:** Modify your FastAPI application (`main.py`) to be managed by `fastapi-mcp`. This typically involves:
    - Importing necessary components from `fastapi_mcp`.
    - Defining "tools" that `fastapi-mcp` will expose. These tools will correspond to your API endpoints (e.g., a tool named `add_memory_to_hub` that calls your `/add_memory` logic, and `search_memory_hub` that calls `/search_memories`).
    - The functions implementing these tools will internally call your existing FastAPI endpoint logic (or you might refactor the endpoint logic into functions that both the direct HTTP endpoint and the MCP tool can call).
  - **Reference:** Consult the `fastapi-mcp` documentation for the exact structure (e.g., using `@app.tool(...)` decorators or a similar mechanism).
  - **Reasoning:** This makes your FastAPI services callable via Cursor's MCP mechanism.
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Integrated fastapi-mcp with automatic tool exposure via mcp.mount().
  - **✅ MAJOR REFACTOR COMPLETED:** Split monolithic main.py into modular structure: config.py (configuration), models.py (Pydantic models), chunking.py (semchunk integration), services.py (core functions), endpoints.py (route handlers), and main.py (app setup). Semchunk integration now properly implemented with real semantic chunking replacing placeholder.
  - **✅ CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT:** Renamed all "deepseek" references to purpose-based names throughout codebase for better maintainability.
    [X] - **Sub-Step 2.3: Running with `fastapi-mcp`**
  - **Action:** Instead of `uvicorn main:app ...`, you will likely run your application using a command provided by `fastapi-mcp` (e.g., `fastapi-mcp run main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001` - _note the port might be different or configured via `fastapi-mcp`_).
  - **Key Outcome:** This should expose an SSE endpoint like `http://<mac_studio_ip>:8001/mcp/sse` (the exact path and port will depend on `fastapi-mcp` defaults or your configuration).
  - **Reasoning:** This is the endpoint Cursor will connect to.
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Server configured to run on port 8000 with fastapi-mcp integration at `/mcp`. Qdrant collection successfully created at startup.

[X] **Step 3: Cursor Configuration (`mcp.json`)**

- **Objective:** Tell Cursor about your new local Memory Hub MCP server.
- **Reasoning:** Allows Cursor agents to see and use the tools exposed by your Memory Hub.

  [X] - **Sub-Step 3.1: Add New Server Entry to `mcp.json`**

  - **Action:** On your machine running Cursor, edit your `mcp.json` file. Add a new entry for your Memory Hub.
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Successfully configured with correct URL `http://192.168.0.90:8000/mcp` and tool names: `add_memory_add_memory_post`, `search_memories_search_memories_post`, `health_check_health_get`.
  - **Final Working Configuration:**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "local-memory-hub": {
          "url": "http://192.168.0.90:8000/mcp",
          "disabled": false,
          "autoApprove": ["add_memory_add_memory_post", "search_memories_search_memories_post", "health_check_health_get"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - **⚠️ Current Limitation:** Environment variables in `mcp.json` `env` section only affect the MCP client, not the server. Server configuration must be done via Docker Compose environment variables or `.env` file on the server machine.
    [X] - **Sub-Step 3.2: Restart Cursor (or its MCP manager if possible)**
  - **Action:** Ensure Cursor picks up the new `mcp.json` configuration. A full restart of Cursor is usually the safest.
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Server successfully connected and tools available in Cursor. MCP integration fully functional.

[ ] **Step 4: Agent Prompting & Initial Testing**

- **Objective:** Update agent prompts to use the new local Memory Hub tools and perform initial end-to-end tests.
- **Reasoning:** The agent needs to be instructed to use the new, fast, local memory system.

  [X] - **Sub-Step 4.1: Update Master/Plan/Implement Prompts**

  - **Action:** Modify your Master, Plan, and Implement prompts to:
    - Remove references to "mem0" or "OpenMemory".
    - Refer to the new tools, e.g., "Use `add_memory_to_hub` to store this plan step" and "Use `search_memory_hub` to retrieve context for `project_id: X` and `ticket_id: Y`."
    - Reinforce the importance of providing `project_id` and `ticket_id`.
  - **✅ COMPLETED:** Updated comprehensive Memory Hub instructions in core user rule. Eliminated custom Plan/Implement modes in favor of unified Agent mode with consistent Memory Hub behavior. Added document chunking strategy guidance (preserve markdown, let semchunk handle division, 12k token threshold).
    [ ] - **Sub-Step 4.2: "Sonny-Seeder" Session with Local Hub**
  - **Action:** Use an agent instance with the "Sonny-Seeder" prompt to populate your new local Qdrant-based Memory Hub with some initial context for a test project (like Humcrush `pg-26`).
  - **Verification:** Check Qdrant (e.g., via its dashboard if available, or by making direct API calls if you build them into your FastAPI app for debugging) to see if data is being stored.
    [ ] - **Sub-Step 4.3: End-to-End Test**
  - **Action:** With a fresh agent instance (using the updated prompts), try a planning session for a new ticket for the seeded project. Observe:
    - Latency of memory operations.
    - Quality of retrieved/summarized context.
    - Correctness of stored information.
  - **Reasoning:** Validates the entire system is working as expected.

- **Process-Based Architecture:** Migrate from URL-based to process-based MCP server (like perplexity-ask) to enable client-side environment variable configuration
- **Environment Variable Support:** Allow developers to configure via `mcp.json` env vars:
  ```json
  "local-memory-hub": {
    "command": "npx", 
    "args": ["-y", "server-memory-hub"],
    "env": {
      "ENABLE_GEMMA_SUMMARIZATION": "false",
      "QDRANT_URL": "http://192.168.0.90:6333",
      "LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL": "http://192.168.0.90:1234/v1"
    }
  }
  ```
- **TypeScript/Node.js Wrapper:** Create MCP SDK-based wrapper that proxies to FastAPI backend
- **Zero-Config Setup:** Enable developers to run `npx server-memory-hub` and have it work like other MCP servers
- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain FastAPI backend for existing Docker deployments while adding npm distribution layer

**VI. Future Technical Considerations (Beyond Initial Build):**

- **More Sophisticated Metadata Filtering in Qdrant:** Explore advanced filtering options in Qdrant if needed (e.g., range queries on timestamps, OR conditions).
- **Intelligent Pre-processing/Enrichment (Gemma):** Fully implement the stubbed logic in `/add_memory` for Gemma to analyze incoming content and suggest better keywords, generate abstracts, or even flag potential near-duplicates before storage.
- **Direct Memory Updates/Deletes:** If strictly necessary, add `/update_memory_chunk/{chunk_id}` or `/delete_memory_chunk/{chunk_id}` endpoints to your FastAPI service and corresponding MCP tools. (Vector DBs are often append-mostly, but direct operations are possible).
- **Admin/Debugging Endpoints:** Add FastAPI endpoints to view stats, peek into Qdrant, clear a project's memories, etc., for your own admin purposes.
