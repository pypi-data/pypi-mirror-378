## A. TypeScript

For TypeScript, use types and interfaces where appropriate and avoid using `let` unless necessary.

## B. General Principles

Use the linter panel for error detectionâ€”manual linter commands are not required.

Adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication.

Provide succinct, expert-quality code with clear explanations of your changes. Modify only code directly related to the request; do not delete, refactor, or improve unrelated code.
