Rust-optimized quadtree with a simple Python API.

- Python package: **`quadtree_rs`**
- Python ≥ 3.8
- Import path: `from quadtree_rs import QuadTree`

## Install

```bash
pip install quadtree_rs
````

If you are developing locally:

```bash
# optimized dev install
maturin develop --release
```

## Quickstart

```python
from quadtree_rs import QuadTree

# Bounds are (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y)
qt = QuadTree(bounds=(0, 0, 1000, 1000), capacity=20)  # max_depth is optional

# Insert points with auto ids
id1 = qt.insert((10, 10))
id2 = qt.insert((200, 300))
id3 = qt.insert((999, 500), id=42)  # you can supply your own id

# Axis-aligned rectangle query
hits = qt.query((0, 0, 250, 350))  # returns [(id, x, y), ...] by default
print(hits)  # e.g. [(1, 10.0, 10.0), (2, 200.0, 300.0)]

# Nearest neighbor
best = qt.nearest_neighbor((210, 310))  # -> (id, x, y) or None
print(best)

# k-nearest neighbors
top3 = qt.nearest_neighbors((210, 310), 3)
print(top3)  # list of up to 3 (id, x, y) tuples

# Delete items by ID and location
deleted = qt.delete(id2, (200, 300))  # True if found and deleted
print(f"Deleted: {deleted}")
print(f"Remaining items: {qt.count_items()}")

# For object tracking with track_objects=True
qt_tracked = QuadTree((0, 0, 1000, 1000), capacity=4, track_objects=True)
player1 = {"name": "Alice", "score": 100}
player2 = {"name": "Bob", "score": 200}

id1 = qt_tracked.insert((50, 50), obj=player1)
id2 = qt_tracked.insert((150, 150), obj=player2)

# Delete by object reference (O(1) lookup!)
deleted = qt_tracked.delete_by_object(player1, (50, 50))
print(f"Deleted player: {deleted}")  # True
```

### Working with Python objects

You can keep the tree pure and manage your own id → object map, or let the wrapper manage it.

**Option A: Manage your own map**

```python
from quadtree_rs import QuadTree

qt = QuadTree((0, 0, 1000, 1000), capacity=16)
objects: dict[int, object] = {}

def add(obj) -> int:
    obj_id = qt.insert(obj.position)  # auto id
    objects[obj_id] = obj
    return obj_id

# Later, resolve ids back to objects
ids = [obj_id for (obj_id, x, y) in qt.query((100, 100, 300, 300))]
selected = [objects[i] for i in ids]
```

**Option B: Ask the wrapper to track objects**

```python
from quadtree_rs import QuadTree

qt = QuadTree((0, 0, 1000, 1000), capacity=16, track_objects=True)

# Store the object alongside the point
qt.insert((25, 40), obj={"name": "apple"})

# Ask for Item objects so you can access .obj lazily
items = qt.query((0, 0, 100, 100), as_items=True)
for it in items:
    print(it.id, it.x, it.y, it.obj)
```

You can also attach or replace an object later:

```python
qt.attach(123, my_object)  # binds object to id 123
```

## API

### `QuadTree(bounds, capacity, *, max_depth=None, track_objects=False, start_id=1)`

* `bounds` — tuple `(min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y)` covering all points you will insert
* `capacity` — max number of points kept in a leaf before splitting
* `max_depth` — optional depth cap. If omitted, the tree can keep splitting as needed
* `track_objects` — if `True`, the wrapper maintains an id → object map
* `start_id` — starting value for auto-assigned ids

### Methods

* `insert(xy: tuple[float, float], *, id: int | None = None, obj: object | None = None) -> int`
  Insert a point. Returns the id used. Raises `ValueError` if the point is outside `bounds`.
  If `track_objects=True` and `obj` is provided, the object is stored under that id.

* `insert_many_points(points: Iterable[tuple[float, float]]) -> int`
  Bulk insert points with auto ids. Returns count inserted.

* `attach(id: int, obj: object) -> None`
  Attach or replace an object for an existing id. If `track_objects` was false, a map is created on first use.

* `delete(id: int, xy: tuple[float, float]) -> bool`
  Delete an item from the quadtree by ID and location. Returns `True` if the item was found and deleted, `False` otherwise. This allows precise deletion when multiple items exist at the same location.

* `delete_by_object(obj: object, xy: tuple[float, float]) -> bool`
  Delete an item from the quadtree by object reference and location. Returns `True` if the item was found and deleted, `False` otherwise. Requires `track_objects=True`. Uses O(1) lookup to find the ID associated with the object and delete that item.

* `query(rect: tuple[float, float, float, float], *, as_items: bool = False) -> list[(id, x, y)] | list[Item]`
  Return all points whose coordinates lie inside the rectangle. Use `as_items=True` to get `Item` wrappers with lazy `.obj`.

* `nearest_neighbor(xy: tuple[float, float], *, as_item: bool = False) -> (id, x, y) | Item | None`
  Return the closest point to `xy`, or `None` if empty.

* `nearest_neighbors(xy: tuple[float, float], k: int, *, as_items: bool = False) -> list[(id, x, y)] | list[Item]`
  Return up to `k` nearest points.

* `get(id: int) -> object | None`
  Get the object associated with `id` if tracking is enabled.

* `get_all_rectangles() -> list[tuple[float, float, float, float]]`
  Get a list of all rectangle boundaries in the quadtree for visualization purposes.

* `get_all_objects() -> list[object]`
  Get a list of all tracked objects in the quadtree.

* `count_items() -> int`
  Get the total number of items stored in the quadtree (calls the native implementation for accurate count).

* `__len__() -> int`
  Number of successful inserts made through this wrapper.

* `NativeQuadTree`
  Reference to the underlying Rust class `quadtree_rs._native.QuadTree` for power users.

### `Item` (returned when `as_items=True`)

* Attributes: `id`, `x`, `y`, and a lazy `obj` property
* Accessing `obj` performs a dictionary lookup only if tracking is enabled

### Geometric conventions

* Rectangles are `(min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y)`.
* Containment rule is closed on the min edge and open on the max edge
  `(x >= min_x and x < max_x and y >= min_y and y < max_y)`.
  This only matters for points exactly on edges.

## Performance tips

* Choose `capacity` so that leaves keep a small batch of points. Typical values are 8 to 64.
* If your data is very skewed, set a `max_depth` to prevent long chains.
* For fastest local runs, use `maturin develop --release`.
* The wrapper keeps Python overhead low: raw tuple results by default, `Item` wrappers only when requested.

## FAQ

**What happens if I insert the same id more than once?**
Allowed. For k-nearest, duplicates are de-duplicated by id. For range queries you will see every inserted point.

**Can I delete items from the quadtree?**
Yes! Use `delete(id, xy)` to remove specific items. You must provide both the ID and exact location for precise deletion. This handles cases where multiple items exist at the same location. If you're using `track_objects=True`, you can also use `delete_by_object(obj, xy)` for convenient object-based deletion with O(1) lookup. The tree automatically merges nodes when item counts drop below capacity.

**Can I store rectangles or circles?**
The core stores points. To index objects with extent, insert whatever representative point you choose. For rectangles you can insert centers or build an AABB tree separately.

**Threading**
Use one tree per thread if you need heavy parallel inserts from Python.
