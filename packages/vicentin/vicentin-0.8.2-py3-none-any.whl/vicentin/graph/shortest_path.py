def dijkstra(graph: Graph, source: int):
    """
    Computes the shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph
    using Dijkstra's algorithm.

    This implementation uses a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently extract the minimum-distance vertex.
    It supports graphs with non-negative edge weights.

    Time Complexity:
        - O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

    Space Complexity:
        - O(V), for storing distances and predecessors.

    Args:
        graph (Graph): The graph on which to run Dijkstra's algorithm.
        source (int): The ID of the source vertex.

    Returns:
        tuple[dict[int, float], dict[int, int | None]]:
            - A dictionary `dist` mapping each vertex ID to its shortest distance from the source.
            - A dictionary `prev` mapping each vertex ID to its predecessor in the shortest path.
              If a vertex is unreachable from the source, it will have `None` as its predecessor.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the source vertex is not found in the graph.
