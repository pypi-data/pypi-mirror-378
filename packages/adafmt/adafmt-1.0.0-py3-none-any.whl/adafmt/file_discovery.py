"""File discovery module for finding Ada source files.

This module provides functionality to discover Ada source files in a project
based on include and exclude path patterns. It recursively searches directories
and filters files by Ada extensions.

Key features:
    - Recursive directory traversal
    - Support for both file and directory paths
    - Exclude path filtering (affects entire directory trees)
    - Case-insensitive extension matching
    - Deterministic sorted output

Supported Ada file extensions:
    - .ada: Generic Ada source files
    - .ads: Ada specification (spec) files
    - .adb: Ada body (implementation) files

ADA_EXTS = {".ada", ".ads", ".adb"}
"""Set of file extensions recognized as Ada source files."""

def collect_files(include_paths: Iterable[Path], exclude_paths: Iterable[Path]) -> List[Path]:
    """Collect all Ada source files from include paths, filtering by exclude paths.
    
    This function implements an optimized algorithm that avoids redundant scanning:
    1. Resolve all exclude paths to a set for fast lookup
    2. For each include path:
       - If it's a file with Ada extension, add it
       - If it's a directory, walk it recursively, skipping excluded paths
    3. Sort results for deterministic output
    
    Args:
        include_paths: Paths to search for Ada files. Can be files or directories.
                      Directories are searched recursively.
        exclude_paths: Paths to exclude from search. If a directory is excluded,
                      all its subdirectories are also excluded.
    
    Returns:
        Sorted list of resolved Path objects for all discovered Ada files
        
    Note:
        - File paths in include_paths are only included if they have Ada extensions
        - Exclude paths affect both directories and files during traversal
        - All paths are resolved to absolute paths before processing
        - Extension matching is case-insensitive (.ADS matches .ads)
        
    Example:
        >>> files = collect_files(
        ...     include_paths=[Path("src"), Path("tests")],
        ...     exclude_paths=[Path("src/generated")]
        ... )
