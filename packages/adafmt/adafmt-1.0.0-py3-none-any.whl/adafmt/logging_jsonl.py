"""JSON Lines (JSONL) logging for adafmt operations.

This module provides a simple logger that writes JSON objects, one per line,
to a file. The JSONL format is ideal for logging structured data that can be
easily processed by other tools.

JSONL format:
    - Each line is a valid JSON object
    - Lines are separated by newlines (\n)
    - File can be processed line-by-line without loading entire content
    - Easy to grep, tail, and process with streaming tools

Typical log entries:
    {"path": "/src/file.ads", "status": "ok", "note": ""}
    {"path": "/src/bad.adb", "status": "failed", "note": "invalid syntax"}
    {"file": "/src/complex.ads", "notes": ["warning: long line", "info: formatted"]}
