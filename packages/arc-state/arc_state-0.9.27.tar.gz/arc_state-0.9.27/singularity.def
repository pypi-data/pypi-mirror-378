    Description STATE - machine learning model for cellular perturbation prediction
    
%help
    This container includes STATE (https://github.com/ArcInstitute/state), a machine learning model
    that predicts cellular perturbation response across diverse contexts.
    
    STATE is trained on single-cell RNA-seq data and can predict how cells respond to various
    perturbations including drugs, genetic modifications, and environmental changes.

    To build with singularity, run:
        singularity build state.sif singularity.def

    To run the container, run:
        singularity run state.sif --help
