    Computes the distance of each row to its k-th closest neighbor. This is useful for outlier detection.
    E.g. if the average distance to the 5th neighbor is 0.1, then a distance of 0.3 to the 5th neighbor might
    indicate that the point might be far away from neighboring points, or that it occupies a sparse region in which
    sample points typically do not appear.

        are running only this expression, and not in group_by() or over() context.
    epsilon
        If > 0, then it is possible to miss a neighbor within epsilon distance away. This parameter

    """
    Takes the index column, and uses feature columns to determine the k nearest neighbors
    to each row. By default, this will return k + 1 neighbors, because the point (the row) itself
    is a neighbor to itself and this returns k additional neighbors. The only exception to this
    is when data_mask excludes the point from being a neighbor, in which case, k + 1 distinct neighbors will
    be returned. Any row with a null/NaN will never be a neighbor and will have null as its neighbor.

    Note that the index column must be convertible to u32. If you do not have a u32 column,
    you can generate one using pl.int_range(..), which should be a step before this. The index column
    must not contain nulls.

    Note that a default max distance bound of 99999.0 is applied. This means that if we cannot find
    k neighbors within `max_bound`, then there will be < k neighbors returned.

    Also note that this internally builds a kd-tree for fast querying and deallocates it once we
    are done. If you need to repeatedly run the same query on the same data, then it is not
    ideal to use this. A specialized external kd-tree structure would be better in that case.

    Parameters
    ----------

    weighted : bool
        If weighted, it will use 1/distance as weights to compute the KNN average. If min_bound is

    min_bound
        Min distance (>=) for a neighbor to be part of the average calculation. This prevents "identical"
        points from being part of the average and prevents division by 0. Note that this filter is applied
        after getting k nearest neighbors.

    This calls `query_radius_ptwise` internally. See the docstring of `query_radius_ptwise` for more info.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *features : str | pl.Expr
        Other columns used as features
    index : str | pl.Expr
        The column used as index, must be castable to u32
    r : float
        The radius. Must be a scalar value now.
    dist : Literal[`l1`, `l2`, `sql2`, `inf`]
        Note `sql2` stands for squared l2.
    parallel : bool
        Whether to run the k-nearest neighbor query in parallel. This is recommended when you
        are running only this expression, and not in group_by() or over() context.

    Return the number of neighbors within (<=) radius r for each row under the given distance

    Parameters
    ----------
    *features : str | pl.Expr
        Other columns used as features
    r : float | Iterable[float] | pl.Expr | str
        If this is a scalar, then it will run the query with fixed radius for all rows. If
        this is a list, then it must have the same height as the dataframe. If
        this is an expression, it must be an expression representing radius. If this is a str,
        it must be the name of a column
    dist : Literal[`l1`, `l2`, `sql2`, `inf`]

    parallel : bool
        Whether to run the distance query in parallel. This is recommended when you
        are running only this expression, and not in group_by() or over() context.
