## introduce:

This python library is mainly used for task scheduling,
for example, there are a bunch of tasks here, the same type of tasks must be queued for execution,
and the tasks need strong management and monitoring

Asynchronous code and normal code are now supported,
specifically with event loops for asynchronous code

## Scope of application

This task scheduling is suitable for:

1.Network Requests: Handling multiple HTTP requests concurrently, where each request can be scheduled and executed
asynchronously.

2.File I/O Operations: Reading from or writing to multiple files concurrently, especially when dealing with large files
or when the I/O operations are slow.

3.Database Queries: Executing multiple database queries concurrently, especially when the queries involve waiting for
database responses.

4.Web Scraping: Running multiple web scraping tasks concurrently, where each task involves fetching and processing web
pages.

5.Real-time Data Processing: Processing real-time data streams, where tasks need to be executed as soon as data is
available.

6.Background Tasks: Running background tasks that perform periodic operations, such as data aggregation, cleanup, or
monitoring.

7.CPU-intensive task execution.

8.Threads in new processes can be well managed.

9.With analysis function, it can analyze which scheduler the execution function conforms.

## Feature description

1.You can send a termination command to the execution code

2.You can enable timeout processing for a task, and terminate the task if it runs for too long

3.When a task fails to run, it can be added to the disabled list and will not be executed thereafter

4.You can directly obtain the current task status through the interface, such as executing: "completed, error, timeout"

5.Automatically hibernate when there are no tasks

## Installation

!!! WARNING: If task is running in a series of blocking tasks such as time.sleep, the task cannot be
forced terminated, it is recommended to use `interruptible_sleep` instead of `time.sleep` for long waits
So, use `await asyncio.sleep` for asynchronous tasks

```
pip install --upgrade task_scheduling
```

# Interface UI

Use the function in code

```

from task_scheduling.task_info import start_task_status_ui

start_task_status_ui()

# Task status UI available at http://localhost:8000

```

# command line use

## Tips

!!! WARNING: Command line running does not support terminating tasks, pausing tasks, and error catching

## Use

```
python -m task_scheduling

#  The task scheduler starts.
#  Wait for the task to be added.
#  Task status UI available at http://localhost:8000
```

## add task

```
use: -cmd <command> -n <task_name>

-cmd 'python test.py' -n 'test'
#  Parameter: {'command': 'python test.py', 'name': 'test'}
#  Create a success. task ID: 7fc6a50c-46c1-4f71-b3c9-dfacec04f833
#  Wait for the task to be added.
```

Use ctrl + c force exit

# Function introduction

## Tips

1.Detailed information requires changing the log level to `debug`.

2.This scheduler does not support terminating blocking tasks due to various factors, so it only supports terminating
tasks by injecting exceptions.

3.Most of the API calls for this task scheduling can be added to the scheduler for execution as tasks.

4.The log display level is available

```
from task_scheduling.common import set_log_level

set_log_level("DEBUG") # INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, WARNING

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ......
```

5.The task priority is modified to high when necessary, and the task will start executing directly after submission.
However, this can also cause some running tasks to pause to free up resources to run high-priority tasks

### Function: task_creation(delay: int or None, daily_time: str or None, function_type: str, timeout_processing: bool, task_name: str, func: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> str or None:

The core function is used to create a task and submit it to the scheduler. Currently the scheduler has
`cpu_asyncio_task, cpu_liner_task, io_asyncio_task, io_liner_task, timer_task`

(The task is of the "io" type) I/O intensive tasks run in the threads of the main process.

(The task is of the "cpu" type)Each task is separate in a process.

This `task_manager` will end the process when there are no threads in the process, so that the process will be recycled

Threaded tasks can be created in this process, and the library provides `task_manager`
that will pass the configuration file `thread_management=True` to the main function
where a new threaded task is created and managed through the task manager, as shown in an example below

### force_stop_task(task_id: str) -> bool:

All 4 schedulers have this function for terminating a running task. Warning: If the function is executing a
process-blocking function such as `time.sleep`, it will have to wait for the execution to finish before terminating the
function

Warn!!! `cpu_liner_task.force_stop_task()` is different and requires the addition of additional parameters

### shutdown(force_cleanup: bool) -> None:

Once the task has been submitted, it is necessary to call this function to clean it up when exiting. Forced cleanup will
interrupt all running tasks, but not if set to False

```
  from task_scheduling.task_creation import shutdown

### update_config(key: str, value: Any) -> bool:

Update the parameters in the configuration file, note that this change will not work after a restart

```
