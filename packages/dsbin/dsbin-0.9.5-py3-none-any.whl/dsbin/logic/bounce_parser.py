"""BounceParser is a utility for parsing and managing Logic bounces. It provides tools for parsing,
sorting, and grouping audio bounce files based on a specific naming convention.

It's designed to work with filenames in the following format:
    "Title YY.MM.DD_Version[MinorVersion][Suffix].extension"

Example:
    "My Song 24.5.1_0a No Vocals.wav"

Key Features:
- Parse bounce filenames into structured Bounce objects
- Find and parse all bounce files in a directory
- Sort bounces by various criteria
- Group bounces by title, date, version, and suffix
- Filter bounces by suffix or file format

Usage Examples:
- Find and parse all bounces in a directory, returning a list:
    bounces = BounceParser.find_bounces("/path/to/bounces")
- Get the latest bounce for each day:
    latest_bounces = BounceParser.get_latest_per_day("/path/to/bounces")
- Sort a list of bounces:
    sorted_bounces = BounceParser.sort_bounces(bounces)
- Group a list of bounces:
    grouped_bounces = BounceParser.group_bounces(bounces)
- Filter a list of bounces by suffix:
    no_vocals = BounceParser.filter_by_suffix("/path/to/bounces", "No Vocals")
- Filter a list of bounces by file format:
    wav_bounces = BounceParser.filter_by_format("/path/to/bounces", "wav")

        This method finds all bounce files in the directory and filters them to include only those
        with the specified file format.

        Args:
            directory: The directory to search for bounce files.
            file_format: The file format to filter by (e.g., 'wav', 'm4a').

        Returns:
            A list of Bounce objects with the specified file format, sorted by date and version.

        Example:
            wav_bounces = BounceParser.filter_by_format("/path/to/bounces", "wav")

            # If the directory contains:
            # - Song A 24.5.1_0.wav
            # - Song A 24.5.1_1.m4a
            # - Song B 24.5.2_0.wav
            # - Song C 24.5.3_0.mp3

            # The result will be a list of Bounce objects for "Song A 24.5.1_0.wav"
            # and "Song B 24.5.2_0.wav", sorted by date and version.

        Note:
            - The file_format comparison is case-insensitive ('wav' will match 'WAV' or 'wav').
            - The file_format should be specified without the leading dot (use 'wav', not '.wav').
            - If no bounces are found with the specified format, an empty list is returned.

        bounces = cls.find_bounces(directory)
        return [bounce for bounce in bounces if bounce.file_format.lower() == file_format.lower()]
