"""Prunes and consolidates bounces from Logic projects.

This script is designed to prune and consolidate bounces from Logic projects. I have a
specific naming scheme that I use to keep track of different versions. Part of that is for
"draft" versions that don't need to be kept for long. This script helps me keep my bounce
folders cleaner (and save disk space) by deleting old bounces that I don't need anymore
and making sure the naming is consistent.

My naming scheme is primarily based on date with an incrementing version number:
- Project Name 23.11.20_0.wav
- Project Name 23.11.20_1.wav
- Project Name 23.11.20_2.wav

Incremental draft versions with very quick and minor tweaks/fixes follow this format:
- Project Name 23.11.20_1.wav
- Project Name 23.11.20_1a.wav
- Project Name 23.11.20_1b.wav
- Project Name 23.11.20_1c.wav

This script will delete 1, 1a, and 1b, then rename 1c to 1, or with the `-d` / `--daily` flag, the
script will consolidate down to one bounce per day named by date with no suffix. The `-s` or
`--skip-latest` flag can be used to skip the most recent day's bounces if work is still in progress.
