**pygeoinf** is a Python library for solving geophysical inference and inverse problems in a coordinate-free, abstract framework. It leverages the mathematics of Hilbert spaces to provide a robust and flexible foundation for Bayesian and optimisation-based inference.

## Overview

The core philosophy of `pygeoinf` is to separate the abstract mathematical structure of an inverse problem from its concrete numerical implementation. Instead of manipulating NumPy arrays directly, you work with high-level objects like `HilbertSpace`, `LinearOperator`, and `GaussianMeasure`. This allows you to write code that is more readable, less error-prone, and closer to the underlying mathematics.

The library is built on a few key concepts:

* **`HilbertSpace`**: The foundational class. It represents a vector space with an inner product, but it abstracts away the specific representation of vectors (e.g., NumPy arrays, `pyshtools` grids).
* **`LinearOperator`**: Represents linear mappings between Hilbert spaces. These are the workhorses of the library, supporting composition, adjoints, and matrix representations.
* **`GaussianMeasure`**: Generalizes the multivariate normal distribution to abstract Hilbert spaces, providing a way to define priors and noise models.
* **`ForwardProblem`**: Encapsulates the mathematical model `d = A(u) + e`, linking the unknown model `u` to the observed data `d`.
* **Inversion Classes**: High-level classes like `LinearBayesianInversion` and `LinearLeastSquaresInversion` provide ready-to-use algorithms for solving the inverse problem.

## Key Features

* **Abstract Coordinate-Free Formulation**: Write elegant code that mirrors the mathematics of inverse problems.
* **Bayesian Inference**: Solve inverse problems in a probabilistic framework to obtain posterior distributions over models.
* **Optimisation Methods**: Includes Tikhonov-regularized least-squares and minimum-norm solutions.
* **Probabilistic Modelling**: Define priors and noise models using `GaussianMeasure` objects on abstract spaces.
* **Randomized Algorithms**: Utilizes randomized SVD and Cholesky decompositions for efficient low-rank approximations of large operators.
* **Application-Specific Spaces**: Provides concrete `HilbertSpace` implementations for functions on a **line**, **circle**, and the **two-sphere**.
* **High-Quality Visualisation**: Built-in plotting methods for functions on symmetric spaces, including map projections via `cartopy`.

## Quick Start: Bayesian Inference on a Circle
Here is a simple example of performing Bayesian inference on a function defined on a circle. We will define a prior, observe the function at a few noisy points, and compute the posterior mean and variance.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pygeoinf as inf
from pygeoinf.symmetric_space.circle import Sobolev


# Set up the model space.
# We define the space of possible solutions. Here, we use a Sobolev space
# on a circle. This space contains functions that are twice-differentiable
# (order=2) with a characteristic length scale of 0.05. The `from_sobolev_parameters`
# method automatically determines the necessary Fourier resolution (kmax).
model_space = Sobolev.from_sobolev_parameters(2, 0.05)


# Set the sample points randomly.
# We will observe the "true" function at 20 random points on the circle.
n = 20
observation_points = model_space.random_points(n)

# Set the forward operator using a method of the Sobolev class.
# The `point_evaluation_operator` is a linear operator that takes a function
# from our model space and returns its values at the specified points.
forward_operator = model_space.point_evaluation_operator(observation_points)
data_space = forward_operator.codomain

# Set the data error measure. If standard deviation is zero, the data is
# free of observational errors.
# We assume the observations are corrupted by Gaussian noise with a
# standard deviation of 0.1. We represent this with a GaussianMeasure.
standard_deviation = 0.1
data_error_measure = (
    inf.GaussianMeasure.from_standard_deviation(data_space, standard_deviation)
    if standard_deviation > 0
    else None
)

# Set up the forward problem.
# The `LinearForwardProblem` object bundles the operator and the error model.
# This fully defines the relationship: `data = operator(model) + error`.
forward_problem = inf.LinearForwardProblem(
    forward_operator, data_error_measure=data_error_measure
)

# Define a prior measure on the model space.
# We define a prior belief about what the "true" function looks like before
# seeing any data. Here, we use a `heat_gaussian_measure`, which generates
# smooth functions. We give it a mean of zero and a pointwise amplitude of 1.
model_prior_measure = model_space.heat_gaussian_measure(0.1, 1)

# Sample a model and corresponding data.
# To test our inversion, we first create a "true" model by drawing a random
# sample from our prior. Then, we generate the corresponding noisy data.
model, data = forward_problem.synthetic_model_and_data(model_prior_measure)

# Set up the inversion method.
# We set up the Bayesian inversion, providing the forward problem and our prior.
bayesian_inversion = inf.LinearBayesianInversion(forward_problem, model_prior_measure)

# Get the posterior distribiution.
# We solve the inversion to get the posterior distribution. The posterior
# represents our updated belief about the model after incorporating the data.
# A Cholesky solver is used for the underlying matrix inversion.
model_posterior_measure = bayesian_inversion.model_posterior_measure(
    data, inf.CholeskySolver()
)

# Estimate the pointwise variance.
# To visualize the posterior uncertainty, we create a low-rank approximation
# of the posterior, which allows us to draw samples efficiently.
low_rank_posterior_approximation = model_posterior_measure.low_rank_approximation(
    10, method="variable", rtol=1e-4
)
# We then estimate the pointwise variance by drawing many samples from this approximation.
model_pointwise_variance = low_rank_posterior_approximation.sample_pointwise_variance(
    100
)
model_pointwise_std = np.sqrt(model_pointwise_variance)


# Plot the results.
# Create the final plot, starting with the true underlying model.
fig, ax = model_space.plot(
    model, color="k", figsize=(15, 10), linestyle="--", label="True Model"
)
# Overlay the noisy data points that were used for the inversion.
ax.errorbar(
    observation_points,
    data,
    2 * standard_deviation,
    fmt="ko",
    capsize=2,
    label="Noisy Data",
)
# Plot the posterior mean, which is our best estimate of the true model.
model_space.plot(
    model_posterior_measure.expectation,
    fig=fig,
    ax=ax,
    color="b",
    label="Posterior Mean",
)
# Plot the 2-sigma uncertainty bounds around the posterior mean.
model_space.plot_error_bounds(
    model_posterior_measure.expectation,
    2 * model_pointwise_std,
    fig=fig,
    ax=ax,
    alpha=0.2,
    color="b",
    label="Posterior (2 std dev)",
)
# Add titles and labels for clarity
ax.set_title("Bayesian Inversion Results")
ax.set_xlabel("Angle (radians)")
ax.set_ylabel("Function Value")
ax.legend()
# Display the final plot.
plt.show()
```

The output of the above script will look similar to the following figure:

* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* pyshtools (for `sphere.py`)
* Cartopy (for plotting in `sphere.py`)

## Future Plans

`pygeoinf` is under active development. Current work is focused on expanding the library's capabilities to address a broader range of geophysical problems. Key areas for development include:

* **Generalised Backus-Gilbert Methods**: Implementation of a generalised Backus-Gilbert framework for linear inference problems. The focus will be on constructing direct estimates of specific properties of interest (i.e., linear functionals of the model) from data, without needing to first solve for the full model itself.

* **Non-linear Optimisation**: Extension of the current optimisation framework to handle non-linear inverse problems. This will involve creating a general interface where users can provide their own non-linear forward mapping, a misfit functional, and methods for computing gradients (and optionally Hessians) for use in gradient-based optimisation algorithms.

* **Non-linear Bayesian Inference**: Development of methods for non-linear Bayesian problems. Planned approaches include linearizing the problem around the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution to estimate posterior uncertainty, and using this linearization to construct efficient proposal distributions for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods.

* **New Geophysical Hilbert Spaces**: Addition of further `HilbertSpace` implementations tailored to specific geophysical applications. A primary focus will be on creating spaces for functions defined within a **spherical annulus** (spherical shell), which is essential for problems in global seismology and mantle tomography.
