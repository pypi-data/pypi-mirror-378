class AutofocusDeviceManager(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class representing a telescope interface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    camera : CameraInterface
        The interface with the camera.
    focuser : FocuserInterface
        The interface with the focuser.
    telescope : TelescopeInterface
        The interface with the telescope, responsible for slewing to a position on the sky.

    Methods
    -------
    perform_exposure_at(focus_position: int, texp: float) -> ImageType
        Take an observation at a specific focus position with a given exposure time.
    move_focuser_to_position(desired_position)
        Move the focuser to a desired position.
    check_conditions() -> bool
        Check if observation conditions are good enough to take exposures. Default is True.
        The implementation of this method is optional, although it is recommended to provide one.
        This function will be used to interrupt the autofocus process if the conditions get bad.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a trivial autofocus device manager.
