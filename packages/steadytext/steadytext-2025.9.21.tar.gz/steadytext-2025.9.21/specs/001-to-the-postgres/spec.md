# Feature Specification: PostgreSQL Prompt Registry

**Feature Branch**: `001-to-the-postgres`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "To the Postgres extension, I want to add a prompt registry that is very lightweight and easy to use. The goal is to have a simple registry table that tracks jinja-based prompts, multiple versions, and provides nifty functions for rendering them. Keeping it very, very lightweight and simple."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a database administrator or application developer, I need to store, version, and render text prompts with variable substitution so that I can manage prompt templates centrally within the database and generate customized text dynamically for AI/LLM interactions or other templating needs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a database with the prompt registry extension installed, **When** I create a new prompt template with variables, **Then** the system stores it with a unique identifier and version number
2. **Given** an existing prompt template with variables, **When** I render it with specific variable values, **Then** the system returns the fully rendered text with all variables replaced
3. **Given** a prompt template with multiple versions, **When** I query for a specific version, **Then** the system returns the correct version of the template
4. **Given** a prompt template identifier, **When** I create a new version with updated content, **Then** the system preserves the old version and creates a new version with an incremented version number
5. **Given** a prompt template with missing required variables during rendering, **When** I attempt to render it, **Then** the system returns an error indicating which variables are missing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when rendering a prompt with undefined variables? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should undefined variables be left as-is, replaced with empty string, or raise an error?]
- How does system handle concurrent version creation for the same prompt?
- What happens when trying to render a non-existent prompt or version?
- How does the system handle malformed template syntax?
- What is the maximum size limit for prompt templates? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: character limit for templates?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create named prompt templates with variable placeholders
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically version prompt templates when they are modified
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a function to render templates by substituting variables with provided values
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow retrieval of specific versions of a prompt template
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain a history of all prompt versions without deletion
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate template syntax when creating or updating prompts
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a function to list all available prompts and their versions
- **FR-008**: System MUST support metadata for prompts (description, created date, author) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which metadata fields are required?]
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to retrieve the latest version of a prompt by default
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle template variables in a format compatible with common templating standards
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide functions that are simple to use with minimal parameters for common operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain referential integrity for prompt versions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: can old versions be deleted or are they immutable?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support prompt categorization or tagging [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: is organization/grouping of prompts needed?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Prompt Template**: A reusable text template with variable placeholders, having a unique name/identifier, content body, and metadata
- **Prompt Version**: A specific iteration of a prompt template, with version number, creation timestamp, and possibly author information
- **Template Variable**: A placeholder within the template that can be replaced with actual values during rendering
- **Rendering Context**: The set of variable name-value pairs used to render a template into final text
