This section of the documentation focuses on providing guidance to developers of
libraries that are integrating Formulaic, users who want to extend its behavior,
or for those interested in directly contributing.

If you are looking to directly work with Formulaic as an end-user, please review
the [User Guides](/guides/) instead.

This portion of the documentation is less complete than user-facing
documentation, and you are encouraged to reach out via the
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/matthewwardrop/formulaic/issues) if you need
any help.
