*   **Interact:** `take` items for your inventory, `drop` them when you need to, and `use` them to solve puzzles.
*   **Solve Puzzles:** Use your inventory and clues from the environment to overcome challenges and open new paths.
*   **Progress:** Every puzzle solved brings you one step closer to the Sky-High Summit and a reunion with your father.
