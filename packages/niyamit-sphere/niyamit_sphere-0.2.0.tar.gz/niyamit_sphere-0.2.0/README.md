A modern Python implementation of the HAZUS flood methodology for building
vulnerability and loss estimation. This repository packages a set of libraries
(`sphere-core`, `sphere-data`, `sphere-flood`) that implement flood
vulnerability functions, lookup tables, and analysis scripts suitable for
research and operational use.

This project is a newer reimplementation of HAZUS flood vulnerability logic
with a focus on clarity, type annotations, and tested, modular code.

Key features
- Building vulnerability functions (HAZUS-derived)
- Flood damage cross-reference and interpolation utilities
- Example analysis scripts in `examples/`
- Test coverage under `tests/`

Quick start
1. Create a virtual environment (Python 3.10+).

```powershell
uv sync --all-packages
```

2. Run tests

```powershell
uv run pytest -q
```

3. Explore examples in the `examples/` directory.

```powershell
uv run examples\fast_analysis.py
```

Development
-----------

There are two convenient ways to work with the workspace packages locally:

- Lightweight dev environment using `PYTHONPATH` (recommended for quick development):

	- Linux/macOS:

		```bash
		source scripts/dev.env
		uv run pytest -q
		```

	- Windows PowerShell:

		```powershell
		.\scripts\dev.env.ps1
		uv run pytest -q
		```

	This sets `PYTHONPATH` so imports like `import sphere.core` resolve against the
	in-repo sources without installing packages into your virtualenv.

-- Meta package (`sphere-meta`): a minimal aggregator distribution that depends on
	`sphere-core`, `sphere-data`, and `sphere-flood`. You can build and install
	`libs/sphere-meta` if you want a single installable package that pulls the
	three distributions from PyPI.

	```powershell
	cd libs/sphere-meta
	uv run python -m build -w
	python -m pip install dist\sphere_meta-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
	```

CI notes
--------

In CI, prefer one of these two approaches:

- Set `PYTHONPATH` (fast): add the paths to `GITHUB_ENV` so tests can import the
	in-repo packages.
- Build wheels for each package and install them (strict): build and install
	wheels in the job before running tests.
