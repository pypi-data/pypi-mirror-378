00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,840
It's true that assembly AI lets you build powerful apps with voice

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,840
data, but is voice really the right word? Maybe

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,440
words, but words on their own are just that, words.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,520
Audio, we hear you. The hearing is

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,600
just a fraction of it. Stack it up and you

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,600
might get closer. But it's more than what we can

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,640
see or hear. It's something in between, around

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,080
and beneath all of that speech.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,340
Speech is more than what you say, it's what you mean. And

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,500
more than the data. The models and. The benchmarks. That's

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,540
what we're excited by at Assembly, AI meaning.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,980
And all of the possibilities that come with it. It's

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,020
why we've built industry leading AI models for speech to

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,299
text and speech understanding. They give you richer. Data,

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,580
incredible accuracy and deeper understanding

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,140
so you can get to the meaning behind voice data and.

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,260
Build products that are more than just. Powerful, they're

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,860
meaningful.
