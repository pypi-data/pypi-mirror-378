"""
Advection Analysis for 1D Aquifer Systems.

This module provides functions to analyze compound transport by advection
in aquifer systems. It includes tools for computing concentrations of the extracted water
based on the concentration of the infiltrating water, extraction data and aquifer properties.

The model assumes requires the groundwaterflow to be reduced to a 1D system. On one side,
water with a certain concentration infiltrates ('cin'), the water flows through the aquifer and
the compound of interest flows through the aquifer with a retarded velocity. The water is
extracted ('cout').

Main functions:
- infiltration_to_extraction: Compute the concentration of the extracted water by shifting cin with its residence time. This corresponds to a convolution operation.
- gamma_infiltration_to_extraction: Similar to infiltration_to_extraction, but for a gamma distribution of aquifer pore volumes.
- distribution_infiltration_to_extraction: Similar to infiltration_to_extraction, but for an arbitrary distribution of aquifer pore volumes.

    retardation_factor : float, optional
        Retardation factor of the compound in the aquifer (default 1.0).
        Values > 1.0 indicate slower transport due to sorption/interaction.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Flow-weighted concentration in the infiltrating water. Same units as cout.
        Length equals len(cin_tedges) - 1. NaN values indicate time periods
        with no valid contributions from the extraction data.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If tedges length doesn't match cout/flow arrays plus one, or if
        extraction time edges become non-monotonic (invalid input conditions).

    Examples
    --------
    Basic usage with pandas Series:

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from gwtransport.utils import compute_time_edges
    >>> from gwtransport.advection import distribution_extraction_to_infiltration
    >>>
    >>> # Create input data
    >>> dates = pd.date_range(start="2020-01-01", end="2020-01-20", freq="D")
    >>> tedges = compute_time_edges(
    ...     tedges=None, tstart=None, tend=dates, number_of_bins=len(dates)
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Create output time edges (different alignment)
    >>> cint_dates = pd.date_range(start="2019-12-25", end="2020-01-15", freq="D")
    >>> cin_tedges = compute_time_edges(
    ...     tedges=None, tstart=None, tend=cint_dates, number_of_bins=len(cint_dates)
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Input concentration and flow
    >>> cout = pd.Series(np.ones(len(dates)), index=dates)
    >>> flow = pd.Series(np.ones(len(dates)) * 100, index=dates)  # 100 m3/day
    >>>
    >>> # Define distribution of aquifer pore volumes
    >>> aquifer_pore_volumes = np.array([50, 100, 200])  # m3
    >>>
    >>> # Run distribution_extraction_to_infiltration
    >>> cin = distribution_extraction_to_infiltration(
    ...     cout=cout,
    ...     flow=flow,
    ...     tedges=tedges,
    ...     cin_tedges=cin_tedges,
    ...     aquifer_pore_volumes=aquifer_pore_volumes,
    ... )
    >>> cin.shape
    (22,)

    Using array inputs instead of pandas Series:

    >>> # Convert to arrays
    >>> cout_values = cout.values
    >>> flow_values = flow.values
    >>>
    >>> cin = distribution_extraction_to_infiltration(
    ...     cout=cout_values,
    ...     flow=flow_values,
    ...     tedges=tedges,
    ...     cin_tedges=cin_tedges,
    ...     aquifer_pore_volumes=aquifer_pore_volumes,
    ... )

    With retardation factor:

    >>> cin = distribution_extraction_to_infiltration(
    ...     cout=cout,
    ...     flow=flow,
    ...     tedges=tedges,
    ...     cin_tedges=cin_tedges,
    ...     aquifer_pore_volumes=aquifer_pore_volumes,
    ...     retardation_factor=2.0,  # Compound moves twice as slowly
    ... )

    Using single pore volume:

    >>> single_volume = np.array([100])  # Single 100 m3 pore volume
    >>> cin = distribution_extraction_to_infiltration(
    ...     cout=cout,
    ...     flow=flow,
    ...     tedges=tedges,
    ...     cin_tedges=cin_tedges,
    ...     aquifer_pore_volumes=single_volume,
    ... )

    """
    Compute extraction to infiltration transformation weights matrix.

    Computes the weight matrix for the extraction to infiltration transformation,
    ensuring mathematical symmetry with the infiltration to extraction operation. The extraction to infiltration
    weights represent the transpose relationship needed for deconvolution.

    SYMMETRIC RELATIONSHIP:
    - Infiltration to extraction weights: W_infiltration_to_extraction maps cin → cout
    - Extraction to infiltration weights: W_extraction_to_infiltration maps cout → cin
    - Mathematical constraint: W_extraction_to_infiltration should be the pseudo-inverse of W_infiltration_to_extraction

    The algorithm mirrors _distribution_infiltration_to_extraction_weights but with transposed
    temporal overlap computations to ensure mathematical consistency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cin_tedges : pandas.DatetimeIndex
        Time edges for output (infiltration) data bins.
    aquifer_pore_volumes : array-like
        Array of aquifer pore volumes [m3].
    cout_values : array-like
        Concentration values of extracted water.
    flow_values : array-like
        Flow rate values in the aquifer [m3/day].
    cout_tedges_days : array-like
        Time edges for cout data in days since reference.
    extraction_tedges_2d : array-like
        2D array of extraction time edges for each pore volume.
    valid_bins_2d : array-like
        2D boolean array indicating valid time bins for each pore volume.
    valid_pv_count : array-like
        Count of valid pore volumes for each output time bin.

    Returns
    -------

        Normalized weight matrix for extraction to infiltration transformation.
