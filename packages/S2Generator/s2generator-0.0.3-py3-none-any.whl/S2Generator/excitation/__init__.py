"""
This module is used to generate stimulus time series data for input into complex systems (symbolic expressions).
It primarily includes five different generation methods:

- [`MixedDistribution`](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/mixed_distribution.py);
- [`AutoregressiveMovingAverage`](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/autoregressive_moving_average.py);
- [`ForecastPFN`](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/forecast_pfn.py);
- [`KernelSynth`](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/kernel_synth.py);
- [`IntrinsicModeFunction`](https://github.com/wwhenxuan/S2Generator/blob/main/S2Generator/excitation/intrinsic_mode_functions.py);

Detailed hyperparameter configuration is provided for each method.
Each method can also generate time series data by passing a random number
generator to the __call__ method or the generate method.

To ensure unified calling, we further encapsulate these five methods into Excitation,
and provide a unified SeriesParams object for parameter management.
