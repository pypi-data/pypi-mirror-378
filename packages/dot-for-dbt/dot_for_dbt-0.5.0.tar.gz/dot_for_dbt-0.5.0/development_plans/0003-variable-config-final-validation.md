# Development Plan 0003: Final Validation of Environment & Variable Configuration Split

Status: Completed  
Date: 2025-09-08  
Owner: dot configuration  

## Objective
Perform a final validation pass of the new configuration architecture:
- `dot_environments.yml`
- `dot_environments.user.yml`
- `dot_vars.yml`

Ensure ADRs, documentation, tests, and code are internally consistent and free from legacy `vars.yml` or deprecated root-level `vars` usage in environment files.

## In Scope
- Existence & content sanity of ADR 0002 & 0003
- Repo-wide search for stale terminology or patterns
- Validation of prohibition of root-level `vars` in environment config files
- README / CONTRIBUTING alignment
- CHANGELOG entry addition
- Test suite execution
- Confirmation of validation semantics (undeclared vars pass through; specs govern only declared ones)

## Out of Scope
- Additional CLI helpers (e.g. generating template specs)
- Extended schema validation beyond current decisions
- Advanced merge strategies beyond documented deep merge of `environment.*.vars`

## Checklist

Repository Structure & ADRs
- [x] Confirm `adr/0002-environment-config.md` exists and reflects environment layering & override precedence
- [x] Confirm `adr/0003-variable-config.md` exists and documents variable specification schema (description, values, strict, required)
- [x] Verify both ADRs marked as Accepted (or equivalent) and cross-reference each other appropriately
- [x] Ensure ADR 0003 contains no deprecation narrative

Code & Implementation
- [x] Verify constants: `PROJECT_CONFIG_FILENAME = "dot_environments.yml"`
- [x] Verify `USER_CONFIG_FILENAME = "dot_environments.user.yml"`
- [x] Verify `PROJECT_VARIABLES_FILENAME = "dot_vars.yml"`
- [x] Confirm loader rejects root-level `vars` in either environments file
- [x] Confirm undeclared variable assignments are accepted without validation errors
- [x] Confirm deep merge only applies to `environment.*.vars` mappings

Tests
- [x] Run test suite (pytest) and confirm all pass
- [x] Confirm tests exist for: root-level vars rejection (project + user), variable spec enforcement (required/strict), pass-through undeclared vars
- [x] Add/confirm test ensuring user override precedence over project values

Documentation
- [x] README reflects 3-file model (no mention of legacy `vars.yml`)
- [x] CONTRIBUTING.md contains no outdated guidance about deprecated patterns
- [x] Example project updated: uses new file names; no root-level vars in environments file
- [x] No lingering references to “deprecated” in our docs relating to this feature

Search & Audit
- [x] Repo search for `vars.yml` (hits only in historical build artifacts / installed dists; none in active source)
- [x] Repo search for regex: `^vars:` inside any `dot_environments*.yml` (zero in active source)
- [x] Repo search for terms: `legacy`, `deprecated` in context of config (none relevant in active source)

CHANGELOG
- [x] Add entry describing introduction of split configuration model
- [x] Note breaking change (if previous unreleased behavior differed) or mark as initial definition pre-release

Finalization
- [x] Summarize results & confirm readiness
- [x] Close this plan (mark complete)

## Approach
1. Static file existence & content inspection.
2. Targeted regex searches to ensure absence of stale patterns.
3. Execute test suite (`uv run pytest -q` preferred; fallback `pytest -q`).
4. Add CHANGELOG entry once validation confirmed.
5. Produce final summary.

## Success Criteria
- All checklist items marked complete.
- Zero failing tests.
- No stale references to legacy naming or deprecated configuration structure.
- ADRs authoritative and internally consistent.
- CHANGELOG updated.

## Notes
If any discrepancies are found (e.g. missing ADRs), they will be created or corrected before proceeding to tests.
