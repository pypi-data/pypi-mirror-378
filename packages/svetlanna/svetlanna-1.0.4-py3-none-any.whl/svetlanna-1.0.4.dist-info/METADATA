         --------------------------------
         
         2.1. Grants
         
         Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
         non-exclusive license:
         
         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
             Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
             modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
             Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
             as part of a Larger Work; and
         
         (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
             for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
             Contributions or its Contributor Version.
         
         2.2. Effective Date
         
         The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
         become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
         distributes such Contribution.
         
         2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
         
         The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
         this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
         distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
         Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
         Contributor:
         
         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
             or
         
         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
             modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
             Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
             Version); or
         
         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
             its Contributions.
         
         This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
         or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
         the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
         
         2.4. Subsequent Licenses
         
         No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
         distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
         License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
         permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
         
         2.5. Representation
         
         Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
         Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
         to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
         
         2.6. Fair Use
         
         This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
         applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
         equivalents.
         
         2.7. Conditions
         
         Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
         in Section 2.1.
         
         3. Responsibilities
         -------------------
         
         3.1. Distribution of Source Form
         
         All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
         Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
         the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
         Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
         License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
         attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
         Form.
         
         3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
         
         If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
         
         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
             Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
             the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
             Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
             than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
         
         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
             License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
             license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
             the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
         
         3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
         
         You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
         provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
         the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
         Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
         Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
         License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
         under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
         the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
         Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
         License(s).
         
         3.4. Notices
         
         You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
         (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
         or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
         the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
         the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
         
         3.5. Application of Additional Terms
         
         You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
         Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
         behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
         such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
         You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
         liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
         indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
         disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
         jurisdiction.
         
         4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
         ---------------------------------------------------
         
         If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
         License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
         statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
         the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
         describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
         be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
         Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
         or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
         recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
         
         5. Termination
         --------------
         
         5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
         if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
         compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
         Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
         Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
         ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
         non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
         come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
         Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
         notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
         first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
         from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
         Your receipt of the notice.
         
         5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
         infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
         counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
         directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
         You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
         2.1 of this License shall terminate.
         
         5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
         end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
         have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
         prior to termination shall survive termination.

         8. Litigation
         -------------
         
         Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
         courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
         place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
         jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
         Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
         cross-claims or counter-claims.
         
         9. Miscellaneous
         ----------------
         
         This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
         matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
         unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
         necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
         that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
         shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
         
         10. Versions of the License

         or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
         steward.
         
         10.3. Modified Versions
         
         If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
         create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
         modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
         any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
         such modified license differs from this License).
         
         10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
         Licenses

# SVETlANNa

SVETlANNa is an open-source Python library for simulation of free-space optical set-ups and neuromorphic systems such as Diffractive Neural Networks. It is primarily built on the PyTorch framework, leveraging key features such as tensor-based computations and efficient parallel processing. At its core, SvetlANNa relies on the Fourier optics, supporting multiple propagation models, including the Angular spectrum method and the Fresnel approximation.

There is a supporting github project [SVETlANNa.docs](https://github.com/CompPhysLab/SVETlANNa.docs) containing numerous application examples in the Jupyter notebook format.

The name of the library is composed of the Russian word "svet", which is the "light" in English and the abbreviation ANN standing for an artificial neural network, and simultaneously the whole word sounds like a Russian female name Svetlana.

## Abbreviations

NN - Neural Network

ANN - Artificial Neural Network

ONN - Optical Neural Network

DONN - Diffractive Optical Neural Network

DOE - Diffractive Optical Element

SLM - Spatial Light Modulator

## Features

- based on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- forward propagation models include the Angular spectrum method and the Fresnel approximation
- possibility to solve the classical DOE/SLM optimization problem with the Gerchberg-Saxton and hybrid input-output algorithms
- support for custom elements and optimization methods
- support for various free-space ONN architectures including feed-forward NN, autoencoders, and recurrent NN
- cross platform
- full GPU aceleration
- companion repository with numerous .ipynb examples
- custom logging, project management, analysis, and visualization tools
- tests for the whole functionality

## Possible applications

- modeling and optimization of optical systems and optical beams propagating in free space;
- calculation of parameters of phase masks, DOEs and SLMs for both classical optical systems and neuromorphic optical computers;
- modeling and optimization of parameters of ONN and DONN for problems of all-optical classification and prediction.

## Recommended technical requirements:

1.	Intel Core i5 8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 1400 or higher;
2.	memory greater than 8 Gb;
3.	HDD/SSD space not less than 16 Гб (virtual enviroment takes about 6 Gb);
4.	for running on GPU you need an Nvidia card with CUDA support and memory not less than 2 Gb;
5.	OS Windows 10 or greater, or Linux with kernel 5.15 or greater;
6.	the library requires Python 3.11.

# Installation, Usage and Examples

For usage there are two options, either run from the source or install from pip.

## Installation From PyPI

```bash
pip install svetlanna
```

## Running From Source

We reccomend first to install [git](https://git-scm.com) in your system.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CompPhysLab/SVETlANNa.git
```
2. Move to the project dyrectory:
```bash
  cd SVETlANNa
```
3. Create a virtual environment for Python 3.11 (see [venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)) and activate it.
4. Istall the Poetry (version 2.0.0 or greater):
```bash
  pip install poetry
```
5. Install all depencies:
```bash
  poetry install --all-extras
```
6. Install the PyTorch (check the instructions at the official [cite](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)). Choose options appropriate to your system. For running the library on a GPU you need to have an appropriate graphic card and a PyTorch version which supports this card.
```bash
  pip install torch
```

## Running Tests

The tests can be executed when the library is running from source only. PIP istallation does not include tests.

NOTE: running tests requires at least 4 Gb of free memory.

To run tests, run the following command (within the activated virtual environment in the library folder)
```bash
  pytest
```

## Examples

Result of training the feed-forward optical neural network for the MNIST classification task: The image of the figure "8" is passed through a stack of 10 phase plates with adjusted phase masks. Selected regions of the detector correspond to different classes of figures. The class of the figure is identified by the detector region that measures the maximum optical intensity.
